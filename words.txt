Evoke the lifesblood of man
The virus we have become
Shedding the skin and bone
Of this species, dead and jaded

In my callous nature
All pity is buried
Flaunt your feigned empathy
Forgotten

I cannot breathe amongst this affliction
Ever more oppressed

Tear away the leeches
And with them, we'll bleed
Strip bare the land, defraud
Or drown within forever

The dust settles on barren dirt
In our chains, we decay

Bound by deceit
The mortal consumed
Beyond death
We are lifeless

The axiom of being
Infinite

The eye burns bright
Laced with scars of deceit
Gazing into the void - the enemy
Betrayed
A dissident reality

Dig deep beneath your skin
Scratches of denial, of emptiness
Inherit unreason
Beg for fate
For we have wasted away

Lay low
The unseen lucid
In an age, fragile and expired
Emancipate

This collective conscious reeks of shadowed delusion
Existence is fear
A saviour from the surrogate utopia

So weep your blood sincere
Drowning in the deadest sky
Grasping the exhausted ashes of hope
Crowned in absolution
The eternal fallen
Suffocate

We are nil

The faces aghast
Consumed with hollow judgment
Those vacant eyes stare through me
With scarred hands to bind
They look back in fear

Fall into the flames of our origin
To lie still and wait

The baseless reverence you adjure
Is condemned by truth

Your divine, cast down from the skies
Cold and wretched
It runs through our veins
This is absolute
This is inherent

The spiritual will sever ties with man
And now alone we exist

From within us
Our worth ascends

Subvert the fallacy
A dying breed on their knees
The scorn of the earth
Obsolete

Subvert the fallacy
A dying breed on their knees
And now alone we exist

The scorn of the earth - the puritan
These days are no anomaly
Your blood will spill like any other

Within the mercy of this revelation
We are forever imprisoned

The helpless wander in vain
To forget all before them
This inner sanction
A blinding vision

Through neglect we falter
All are subservient

To burn out the absolute
Shadow our nature

Crawl into the darkest of holes
With reason forbidden we fade
And our shattered remains will lay to waste

This is our weakness, our failing

Suffer at the hands of those we feed
With wounds to show for nothing
Breathe the ashes of our burning past
To swallow whole, the denial

These self-conceived walls close in upon us
And we shall never see the light of day

Shadowing the blinding light
From within our confinement
The hollow stare of thousands pierce the soul

Reject the innate
And no solace will prevail
Our bloodless tower over all
With their eyes full of god
They are blind to our dawn

Scream to the silent masses
Caution to their winds of contempt
Release me
To rise from their ruins

The roots of the mortal
Masked with our atrophy

Born of man, the tyrant
Reborn

The misguided rise now
Untainted and pure
Stand in ignorance
And fall in neglect

In inherent sorrow
Rip open your heart for me
The undeserving
Grieve for all

From rise to fall
We preach our dream
Dishonour

With the coldest shoulder
The balance is broken
So with disdain you may burn me forever
In anti-human desperation
This is the horror that binds us all

Buried beneath with our martyrs
Buried beneath with our scapegoats

The earth falls to its knees

The misguided rise now
Untainted and pure
Stand in ignorance

Our devotion
Our redemption
Are our own
My eyes are open

Etched into the earth's effigy
The graven image of man
Inhale your idols and parasites
Cold blood of the declining all

Visions of desire cut deep
Reject them and rot
Rot away in worthlessness
In fear, in isolation, in realisation

In fear of inferiority
Swallow the blunt reality
This earth bleeds for no one
Indifference is your existence
Indifference is your execution
Cower in shame

The shadow stalks in the wake of regret
My eyes roll back to never see again

And on my deathbed I remain silent
I cannot uphold the dogma
I will not shed this trusting secret
The coming soullessness embraced
Darkness
Fortitude
Nothing

To our end
To our blackest days we have come
Our demise, barren and futile

We are lost without fate

Reap what we have sown
We diminish, all nameless

And the realisation manifests
Only once will this burn
To diminish, all nameless
Only once will this ever burn

Recreate our failure
To relive, to revel in the boundless shift
For the bane of man and of all
Is now imminent

And the realisation manifests
Only once will this burn
And the realisation manifests
For nothing we know

The hollow will of the undying faithful
Belies us
Belies our being

Between this state and the next
We are lost
We are without fate

This burning inside cannot be defined
Our empty convictions erode in time

Stand on the edge of abandon
And stare into the searing sun
Forfeit now
For nothing we know

Everything is fire

Atop the shameless tower
With wings outstretched
An apprehensive shadow is cast over all
Drain us of our divinity
And leave us dry amongst the dirt of men

In the worst of our nightmares we are weak and servile

We, as martyrs
Fear runs through our veins
Hung for grandeur and fate
We hang lifeless

With blind eyes turned from daylight
We deny
With blind eyes turned from the glare of being
Loathe that which we are

I abhor the undiscerning
No more of my blood will be shed of pity
With an empty and unforgiving heart
Once more, I scream to the sky

For I am mine
The rot of subordination I burn away

The primeval genesis
Etched into forgotten flesh
In darkness, oblivious, we exist to no avail

To no avail
To never unearth

The insipid with their deadpan stare
Long for worth in dying oceans
To never unearth

By the scorn of weakness
Lay me to rest

Rip away the flesh we scarred with god
And scour our bones for deceit
Beneath the black shroud of abandon lay fields of us
Our bodies still; our minds hollow and sightless

Here we lay, nothing without deceit

The immortal, reflected in dead oceans
Drowned by frailty tied at their feet

Even still in death, this falls on deaf ears

I am the eyes of our inception
Sewn shut

Sleep now, willing hosts
In envy, accede to this void of life so bleak and fragile
There is only silence here
No resistance

A silent corrosion of mind

This innocence lost
The tide long retreating
You cannot see above the walls, encircling high

This sanctuary and its need, infectious
You will not see again
The infected will never see again

To claim this as nothing
You should not be of this world
Of those who preach death
Your words are poison
And those of stone in apathy
You crawl with them

You crawl with them in decay

This cold becoming never dethroned

Of those who claim this fire as nothing
I will forever despise

Rejection
In gasping air from vast surrounds
Subjection to all that breathes it
Suffocate in the idle and empty
It calls for no one

The beast of no will
Gives rise the servants of cause
They hold their breath as it sets behind the hill
Banishing them to the dark

It will set and rise again and again

Speaking only of your end
It pierces your unyielding pretence
The illusion shattered and exhausted

It will set and rise
Dull and fruitless
It will set and rise again and again
With no ambition

Shallow worship of the azure and the earth
Not as they are or have been
Betrayed and distorted
Dragged through tarnished waters and purged in tongues

Gouge no deeper
For our hollow souls are upon us

Our hollow souls, our enemies, upon us

The marred hands of our leper idols wring us of all hope
Our hollow idols wring us of all hope
We have betrayed ourselves
And now forever lie dormant

Trailing this solemn road at dusk
At its end, we leave no mark
We have no future
We will be rightfully forgotten

The reverence of those lost owed to the land
To us it is withered and worthless
To us it does not belong

What of this radiance we have left behind?

Creatures of abyss, born of vice
We are not they
They preach chaos and delusion
And welcome it without breath

With the omens in flame
We are still; we desert the truth

Truth has no name here
Anonymous in clouded vision
Our disgrace, far from reach
Left unknown

They fall from spoiled skies
Strangled of grace
And know only to mask their vile faces

They know not the figure staring back at them;
Not their beginning nor end
They surrender in blissful fate

The undying pariah
To which the cowards shun and beg remission
Cold-blooded and callous
It does not grieve

It will never grieve

So detached, the destroyers
Wide eyed in rapture and unfulfilled
In ignorance they remain
Until their ruin

Bring me the comfort of cold inertia
Bring me the graves, poised for our leaden demise

Our extinction, seeded in blind avarice

Come dawn, no light will be thrown on them
This vermin, these ingrates
Us of the earth
The destroyers of all

Blame tarred with cursed ivory brush
Halos to sever heads of those below
Two millennia with faded words to burn
Fall to your knees or immolate your soul

Lungs filled with black
Cough of the wretched
I can taste the soot on my tongue
Deny the idle threats of those empty smiles
For deceit and dreams often are one

This skewed reality, dizzying and sweet
Open hands to trap the moth
Corrupt veins pump soured blood
The trap is set, poison awash

Heads to turn for the promises betray
Chisel to stone with the world to pay

With the eyes to the sky, faith begat misery
With eyes to the sky, the world shall burn away

I rise, for I can stand alone

Bound and gagged
Yet professing the importance of these putrid regurgitations
Dangling above the precipice
Fate, tragic and deserved, lies below
Vacuous and nightmarish

Docile and servile
Kiss that which feeds and fucks
Devoured, defiled
We hang

Choking ourselves on this rank vomit
Seems we can't get enough
Gorging on this stale repetition
For time does not exist to us

And when the gag is removed, sodden and rancid
Mouths will remain agape
Like baby birds, trusting and needy
Even as the rope is cut
Dead eyes long for the normality
Long for the masochism
And set free the sadist in us all

Cut away and start again

Cross out these serpentine eyes
Milk them for all they're worth
Shatter the white with jane doe hammers
Slay the beast with three billion heads

Through noise and movement, filth is revealed
I can smell the decaying musk
Stale breath reeks of lust and violence
And shaking hands reveal the rest

For I am nausea
From you to me

Insight crawls, drunk and bruised
Deep within the leaden grey
But majority rules with iron fist
So swallow the blood and cover the face

A new slate is needed for this cannot be cleaned

To turn the other cheek
Or cut it open and rip out the tongue
For now and for this
Forgiveness is rot

I'd trade it all for a chance to mend
To kill, to cleanse, to purge, to end

Loathing saturates, sour and foul
Only to be eclipsed by the sorrow
To cut away those close and near
Pull back the hammer and let it swing
Let it swing

Revelation or annihilation

The futile and the fanatics
That is all we are
With scalpel incisions and flapping tongues
Bury the limbs of the hopeless

Clambering onto the funeral pyre, overwhelmed
Sacrifice and sedition
Let the ashes of our cancer rise
To be inhaled by the congregation

Carry your doctrine into the flames
Or swallow it whole and exit the wake

As the smoke blackens the horizon
Revel in your decision (delusion)
As the inferno turns to embers
Breathe in the essence of despair

Piss on the ash and the bones of the dead
Laugh and rejoice as the black turns blood red

But your carnivorous smile betrays
Revealing the teeth that will devour us all

A grin to mark the end of days

Lynch the god of disease
And sever his wings
Hang him upon the red beneath the green

But the tyrants and sinners are waiting in line
And the mob is thinning and there is no time
With the blind masturbating the blind
The prophets are left with no one to lead

To fall on your sword
Or charge from the trench
Fall in to the black
Or choke their fields with our dead

Within the agony of the conscience
To gorge at the trough or to starve to death
Aversion of truths or affirmation of life
History to live or history to end

With the pinnacle past and crevice below
To leave the concrete to crack and the steel to corrode
Turn your back on this den of murderous thieves
Or with stone in hand do we go for the head?
A chance to cripple, cut them off at the knee
A wrench in the works to fuck the machine

Here we exist upon the cliff tops
Exhausted and empty
Sneering into the darkness below
Wet palms, coppery and thick
Lines of red to mark our progress
But to what end?

We are a part of this plague
Unclean and naive
We climb upon the cross
To be crowned?

This will deaden all but the brightest lights
And I personify the black

I am despair

Fall away
Resign yourself to this faithless leap
For there can be no half measures
And the noose is already around our necks
Jerk awake with the revelation
And dangle above the maggots
The twine exists as the separator
Through suffocation and sodden eyes
She will not hold

Let me hang here, till sleep
To end my nightmare, to let me dream
To lie beneath the soil, alone
To let the world grow old

Blackness, inside to out
Like a benign tumor turned terminal
Here we are at the dawn our conclusion
Penned, paid for and played out by us all

Seconds slow as we count down to death
Reflection eclipsed by blame to place

Fingers point in every direction
While resting on hair triggers
The gun is our callous indifference
The bullet is what we have become
We have fellated fate for far too long
Taste our infliction, and know that we were wrong

There is a beauty within this violent paradigm
And that lies with the inevitability of our end

Staring into the abyss of man
Empty, consumed, ruled by its dead hand

May the horror of human nature
Feed the horror of realization

Caskets for empires founded on fault lines
Caskets for empires

Brightest white, blinding
Angelic and rustic
The greatest beauty I’ve ever breathed

I for one know what this is
The great redeemer
Our bastard child
Let it rise

Standing aside the crippled dreamer
We begin to understand the design
And prepare to climb back into the womb
To be reborn as bone and ash

Absolution is all that remains
Swallow the truth and chase it with blame

In bliss, watch our smiles melt away
Wash us away, drowned in relief
Still and open for the first and last time
Repaid and returned

Let our blood mix with the soil
The earth soaked in us all
Our sorrow and our pardons
Now, my good friend, we are even

This is our end
Forge

The parasites inhale, devour and discard
Vermis
Before an empty gaze
Stand to proclaim the end
The corrupt control and deliver fate
Bring ruin upon us

When we lie abject before them
Erode our being
Denounce the visceral
Absolve our fear

These are the depths of the repressed
Condemned to descend further

Awaken to the manifest
The air devoid of honour

Stained truth will blacken all
There is no more light
I will die before I succumb to indoctrination
Declare war

Revere; exalt
At the word of the vermin
Surrender

Weigh on the complicit
A black mark
Indelible shame
Their names to endure suffering
The judgement laid before me
It will not rest

The ground cannot be upturned
To retract the past
To bury sin
Our error will bear consequence

Misled by the spineless
Regress
Silenced by the callow
We cannot retreat

See the evil, falling dark
Hear the evil in clear warning
We dare not speak

Lost in the implicit unknown
Impetuous dissent
Reject the cold and lifeless order
Offer nothing but reproach

Devalue the thoughtless waking breath
To belittle unseen dejection
Beyond concern of the impassive
The unavailing diminished

Adrift in salvation
Enraged to affliction

I am beholden to no one
The world disavowed
Deconstructing adversity
In fear

The aggrieved are without claim
Without sentence
Clutching revulsion
For those whose fear is just

Reckoning is upon the meek

The drones march through barren wasteland
Without expression
Broken souls corroded by fear
Deprivation exhausts the last fire

Their will is buried
Within hearts of black ash
Gasping for air
Beneath the weight of empty minds

The paralysis of isolation

Exist in parallel
Exist in ignorance
Divorce and dismiss

From deep in the abyss
There is no release

No pity for the destitute
Of the land stained in blood
Left deserted to face futility

We must not dream of virtue
Us poisoned elite
We are void

Decry the willing
Decry the resolute
The desperate grasp releasing
In refusal to subsist

An endless aperture
Is the essence of their disposition
Obtuse at the surface
Pernicious in being

Cut through the superficial, cursory effusion

What is ignored in the present
Will be resurrected

The forsaken confront entropy
Alone, helpless, wandering toward demise

Eyes of the viral and absolute
To never be met as equal
Pollute the masses
Their past ordained
Their future annulled
For the dominion of the vain

Dictate the righteous
Inhuman decree
Boundless hate and callousness
Spare no blood
Not the congenial nor kindred
The austere concede only to their means
And their ends served only in death

Inside the fractured mind lay decrepit convictions
Embedded and never erased

Unashamed
Unchallenged
Unmoved
The imperious weak

Becoming damnation
Assure the path to infamy
Fall to opprobrium

Within the prison bereft of hope
Collapse is determined

Unashamed
Unchallenged
Unmoved
The imperious weak

Hallow guise of the betrayer of man
Lead us blind
Immersed in contempt for all
Embodied; consumed by their dogma

The doctrine of nothingness

We have reached a dead end
The idle are no longer ignorant

Pull us through the path of dirt
To be admonished
Drag us under the current
To a slow death

Embrace the resentment
Withdraw from the mind
Be cast above the masses
Command on high

Worship
Emanate
Control
Infect

This end long written
Under thin skin of the self-serving

See through the enduring
Denounced from beneath the burden
Owed not another word

Call upon apparition
To answer a fervour for cessation of time
So thinly veiled yet resolute
Submit and become worthless

Unchain totality
And be witness to chaos

Darkness
Cold and vacuous
Sink under its power
Swallow those within

They of unjust order

Frail
Broken
Mortal

I am released
Upon acknowledging our terminal nature
Liberated from immortality

All that has amassed
May not be long of life

Disown in vain
Await rescission

We will remain stagnant
Before observing the reflection without prejudice

Frail
Broken
Mortal

Gathered for a sacred rite
Subconscious minds allied
Call upon immortals
Call upon the oldest one to intercede
Rid us of our human waste
Cleanse our earthly lives
Make us one with darkness
Enlighten us to your ways

From churning worlds of mindlessness
Come screams unheard before
Haunting voices fill the room
Their source remaining undefined
Shadows cast from faceless beings
Lost for centuries

Lords of death, I summon you
Reside within our brains
Cast your spells upon our lives
So that we may receive
The gift of immortality
Bestowed on those who seek you

Laugh at the tragedies
Mock with disrespect
Goats under rule of father time
Leaches pass judgement on their fellow kind
And die when their inner self goes astray
Alas, I pay homage to the ancient ones
Speak my name!!
Raise the staff of the morbid priest
Descend into the fires of the true law

Suffocating evil smoke arise
Cleansing the masses of iniquity
Cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
Vile crematory burns my eyes

Mortals filled with despair
They quest to foresee their fate
Caverns below await the wine to flow
Rape the harvest of souls
I watch in awe as the crucifiers march
Killing time, killing all I see
Another moon rise, human waste
Screaming 'Why hath thou forsaken me ?'

It's the dawn of the crucifiers
Suffocation

Dark eyes, shadows grim
They come for me
Midnight chimes, blackened earth
The evils rise
Pits of hate open wide
Chasm of my dreams
Last of chimes - monks arrive
And take my mind again

Waste polluted memories
Acid rivers flow
Vigil for this land's decay
Sounding from below
Dogs of war, Satan's own
Plotting all their sins
Weapons aimed at liberty
My vision - no one wins

Take my mind
All the way
The darkside calls
I shan't resist

Men forever rot in pain
Mind machines control
Toxic rains scouring brains
Victimizing souls
Winds of war suffocate
Voodoo in the sky
Breathe the gases, breathe no more
My vision - all will die

Take my mind
All the way
The darkside calls
I shan't resist

Cut myself and release the blood
Pains of a thousand years
Pathetic sights - journey's end
Descent into another world
My time has come to meet the
Masters... all the corporate lords
I'm not afraid to face all their
Trials - slavery - in the end they'll
Still have no power over me

Daylight shines blind my eyes
Waken to another day
Tribulation now has passed
But the dreams remain
Walls of sleep fade away
Abandonment of wonders
Monks of knowledge bid farewell
And leave me with these visions
From the darkside

Visions - from the darkside

Life betrayal - a warping rage
Evil ripping caverns through your mind
Immolation - in blood you've signed your soul away
Sickening life ends but the horror has just begun

Vultures moaning a funeral dirge
Walls await to cradle you and rip your soul apart
Incessant screams echoes through the maze
Insanity approaches - imminent demise

Maze of torment...
Maze of torment...
Maze of torment...
Maze of death

Stricken from the holy book deliverance to pain
Effigy of Jesus Christ burning in your mind
Voices cry out to bid you welcome
Locked within the dungeons of darkness - no escape!!

Maze of torment...
Maze of torment...
Maze of torment...
Maze of death

Passing through corridors embedded with
Scars of those who have gone before you
And left their marks

Warning comes to late to save you now
Visions of suffering stab from the inside

You pray for death
Mourning does no good as you can only die once

Souls are being raped by the maze
Lost in these halls... endlessly

Open my eyes
Hear my cries
Plumed serpent of the deep
Plumed serpent of the gate
I command - come before me
I command - bring the key
Rise from the depths
See the fire in my wand

I call forth the god pazuzu
I call forth the lord of plague
I am of the lost
Creatures of spawn of hate
Rejoice in the heaving earth
Praise the ripping sky
Rise spread disease
Consume their puny souls

Ride the wings of death...

Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards Hell
Writhe in Satan's flames

Crush the priest
The feeble church

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold Satan's rise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altar

Demons attack with hate
Satan in the fires of Hell awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call

Come to me, lord of filth
Hear my cries princes of nightmares
Touch us with your morbid lips
Let us taste your foulness

Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soul

Fill the air with the smell of death
Grace us with your magic
Fill the night with the stench of evil
I summon forth the beast

Cold look in his eyes
He holds the gleaming knife
Girl cries as he cuts away the
Strips of flesh

Evil Minds grievous sins
Pagan lives have no place for law
Twisted worship exhume the dead
Minds unite for evil cause
Death corrodes the book once strong
Evil lord destroys his foes
Plague has spread throughout the land
Revelations have begun

Call of evil's mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
Exterminate the altar of laws
Atrocities of a new Reich
Holy war and holocaust
God weeps and turns his back
The time is right to destroy the world

Damnation
Fill the world with plague
Force of devastation
Tyranny from above


Churning of cities lust so profane
Driving the will to destroy
Crippling powers I'm forced to partake unholy rituals
Crimes of a world barely alive
Melting debauchery
Ashes to ashes, so must I be
Lost in this misery
There's nothing left here for me
I know of no other way
Even death cannot change my ways
I'm first in the line
To hell we shall go

Call of evil's mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
The time is right to destroy the world

I am the god of gods
Master of the art
I desecrate the chaste
Writhe in the flesh

Chant the blasphemy
Mockery of the messiah
We curse the holy ghost
Enslaver of the weak
God of lies and greed
God of hypocrisy
We laugh at your bastard child
No god shall come before me

Blaspheme the ghost 
Blasphemy of the holy ghost


Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
Rebel against the church
Drink from the chalice of blasphemy
Rise up against the enslaver

Caught within my evil spell
Now it's time to burn in hell
You were fooled on return
You're just a doll for him to burn
See the reaper in his eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Brain washed with sin and death
Time to burn - my evil wrath

Bring the children down to burn
Once you fall - no return
Sin takes you by surprise
On this backwards hellbound ride
Gates of hell drawing near
Satan loves the taste of fear
Quenching all with black desire
Burn your souls in furnace fire

Evil spell of the dead
Messengers of your death
Falling endless in your tomb
Locked within infernal doom
See the reaper in my eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
Baking soul within your screams

Hot wind burns me
Burning as I fall
Cast away

Speechless in the holy way
I survive
The scourge and banishing
To scorching land
I am lord, I take command

Forgive me not
This knowledge makes me strong
To resurrect
The cities of the damned
All the treasure of sodom
Now belong to me - celebrate
Fallen angels take my hand

Fall from grace

Whores long for my flesh
And my desire
Lust anointing me now
Consume my soul

I writhe in the flesh and the sins of hell...
I am Belial
I bend my knee not but for my selfish desire

	Gods transform me
The storm will cleanse me
Civilized I shall not be
By the holy strain of laws

I fall below the earth
I smell the ancients breath
The fiends encircle me
They speak my name in tongues

For I'm no human now
I burn the ways conform
The gods are pleased with me
They speak my name in tongues

I am the seer
I know the texts divine
Thunder words
Demons race into my eyes

Azazel
Lend me your wings of twelve
I shall fly into the storm
I, son of fire, in anger become
The lightning bolts that strike the earth

War-kills on the land
Blood-saturates

Hallowed ground
To which my fathers fell
Rebel souls
Buried deep beneath
This hallowed ground
Land of my ancestry
Drink the blood
Rebel lands rise again

War-death lingering
Blood rivers flow
In sacrifice

Unholy war
Implored from below
No peace as rebel lands rise

Quaking below my feet
Mortals shall suffer defeat
Forgotten evils below
Rejoice as the blood flows

A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come for me
And again you must die

So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words, feel my hate descend

Lord of light
I will swarm against you now
Gods perverse
Wicked at my side
Misery
Thorns to lance your every word
Nazarene
Now I crown you king in pain

To plague and moan
So many years my seed condemned
Now free to soar!!!

Will is yours? So, creator
No intent could shadow
My disease... ever lusting pain

World of sickness
Blessed are we to taste
This life of sin

My touch is inhumane
Nocturnal beast inside
Is void of light
And empty shall remain

Rise through the gate
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... They eat your mind

Evil undisguised
Breathe in pain
Blackened souls remain

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy Jehovah’s church
Vomit upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

Evil one
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross

Churning Sea of Absu; Place of weeping Death
Tiamat, dark serpent, Lord of the morbid Priest
Enraged with Hate for God, The Priests of Chaos chant
From the Book of the Worm, they burn the Symbols of Christ

We spit on the virgin Lamb, and mock the Words he spoke
His ways not worthy of me,
We choose to burn in the Pits of Hell

Wreakers of Death and Havoc inflicting never ending Pain
Sing the Words of Emptiness, The Formula of Death
Call the Queens of Death and the God of the Dead
The Sea of Absu rolls... rising Spirits
Bow down before the Master and pray the Defeat of God
Prayer of the Ensnarers... Blind Fiends of Chaos rule!

...Rise up 'o Powers of the Sea... In the Name of the Absu I call
Come and carry my curse to the Ones who cause me Disgust
May they burn in my Cauldron, for they are as molten Wax
...Burning, Consume their Powers... So mode it be

Liars in Waite, the Priests of the Night
Make Images to burn by the Moon
Robbing the Spirit, raping God's Law
Send up our Hate to burn Heavens Gate

Locked deep beyond the gate
Lost within the stars
Realm of the ancient ones
Malignant ones
Against the light
Power of the blackened sky
Hateful spawn "We are the chasm depths"

Come forth ancient ones
Rise, greet the cursed with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With your infernal grasp

A scorn from the Absu
Snaps his jaws
Cauldron burns and receives
Crushing the voice of the tyrants
Raise the horns in blasphemy

Before that which is, all was not
Less the Sweet Waters 
Triumvirate of Most High

Spirits of the Deep Waters, remember
Humbaba, Lord of the Forest, remember

From the Sweet Bitter, all that is came
Creation of man and their gods
But man, fashioning overwhelm
Could not see the Light which he holds

Spirits of Purifying Flames, remember
Gods of the Skies, remember
Judges of Ur, remember
Weighers of the Truth, be praised

The gift of flesh
Was in fact life's curse
Although born one in the same
In Spirit, but the flesh all too coarse

Discord, among the gods of men
Although they were brothers
Diversities grew
Overshadowing their connection
On the clearest of days they are
One in the same
Pettiest of purpose
Degenerates things to their crudest form
Being loathsome 
Brothers do battle
Principalities of folly
Disturbs the Mummu
The One Who Bore All was
Appalled by their ways
Her Dream Time was of no peace
Their fleshly behavior
Overbearing and proud
She despised them

The Ways of the Underworld are Perfect
Not to be questioned by that of the brute
Clearly beyond the understanding
Of that which is ruled by the drives of the flesh
For whom shall then oppose
The Lights of Satan, Purifying Flames
Come child, the Anunnaki wait
Truth is the Weapon no pity it holds

The ways of the flesh
Barbaric behavior patterns
Flesh over Spirit, the motivator of the worthless
The ways of the flesh
The evolution is minimal
I watch as your kingdoms rise and fall
Causing no effective change
Your military
Command structure of impotence
A gross misuse of force
By leaders who lack in vision
Your gods
Evidence of your weakness
Your focus is one with delusion
You worship that which means your end

Rise up, O Mahummuhu
The Judgement is passed
The treachery is clear
They shalt become empty like the wind
The emptiest of shells so shall they be
O Great Mother
The Armies shall rise with Weapons
No pity they hold
From Your Great Mummu
The Serpents shall come
Venom for blood
And the Glory of Gods

Spirits of the Flames, remember
Anunna, Gods of the Skies, remember
Anunnaki, Judges of Ur, remember
Anunnaki, Weighers of Truth, be praised

Blessed Be The Ones
The Most Ancient Ones
Blessed be the Ones
Who were here before and after remain
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh
I watch as it withers and dies

Come with Storm and
Blow the flesh from this earth
Come with Flood and
Wash away the flesh from this earth

The mighty of this world are only
Mighty of the flesh
But that of flesh
Is crushed by that of the Mountain
For it is written that
The future of flesh is dust
You are but a shell
Your wine something unseen

Come with Fire and
Burn the flesh from this earth
Make the Earth upheaval
May it swallow up the flesh of this earth

Your dreams
Mundane delusions 
My dreams
The Continuum Force that devours all things
Dreams
That eat the flesh and drink the blood
My brothers
It is your time to feed

Your will
Empty promises you can't fulfil
My will
Brings avalanches of abundance
Power
Of the Gods circulate within my veins
I lie in wait
Being that erodes all things

You quake the earth
Scorcher of skies
Your Towers of Flames
You've come to Cleanse the treacherous act
You've come to Tame the rebelliousness

Unmatched Your Principle is unopposed
The Light You hold unmatched is unopposed
You glide across and beneath the lands
Your Affects engulf the rebelliousness


Terror
Your Battle Roar seeds
Terror
No shield can withstand
The Seven Weapons of Flame
The Principal Force that You wield

Captive
The hostile ones are held
Captive
The insubmissive are
Brought to their knees
For they cannot counter
Your massive assault upon them.
The ill-natured
You've Burned from our land
Hostile gatherings You've Tamed
You were unmatched
No counter could be found
With Fury and Flames
You Scorched their aggressiveness

O Lion-head, Your awesome Blaze of Fire consumed the gathering
of the treacherous and the ill-natured.
Purifying them.

It is Thine Aura, awful lights,
overwhelming the enemy lands

O Lion-heads, with Your most awesome Rising Power.
Destroyer of the gathering of the enemy gods.

Your Great Net, being so enormous
swallowed the disobedient ones,
binding their hands.
How can you defeat that which
Finds nourishment in your attack?
How can you kill that which
Finds sanctuary in your blade?
How can you hinder that which
Embraces the strategies against it?
You can take nothing from not

In My Being, Nothing Is
Nothing Becomes
Nothing is not
In your world, all things return to Me

I'm the Collector of Souls
For they're never past my control
I take of what is and nothing of that I give
I'm the Alpha Omega
My Way in Itself, complete
I Am The Continuum

Human, meagerness of purpose
Come feed Me what I please
My spirit shan't be hindered
For It Knows no weakness
I dine on your pain
Your strength is only that of men
Human, why do you clutch your flesh so?

I Will
I Create
In your world all things return to Me

You give praise to the statues
of gods
Dispirited, they hear you not
You give offering to metal and stone
Dispirited, how can they respond?
The faith dishevelled
Temples distained
You praise the mere shadows of gods
The word, discolored and vain
And the Gods, they know you not

They come when the Spirit speaks
But your words disdainful
Words spawned by the cultureless beings
Disclaimed by the once attentive Gods
Disarmed, the power words are empty
Your way being left to the winds
Bitter is the wailing of the sheep
Even now the memories are dis

Barren, the temple's reason was loss
In vulgarian was it swallowed
The mundane, so disbanded they are
Not of purpose can they find
The Great Mother, as if a criminal
Disaffiliated from One's people
Unwelcome like the rival of a culture
Removed, unwelcome She stands

Disarrayment of the Values' Core seeds discord
For now fulfilment cannot be formed
And the sheepfold mourn
In the forge of our will we manifest ourselves
Empowering our world
Yet the fables of a failed faith
Show the effects of this spiritual dis

Empty, the Gods disavow you
Understanding you have lost
For what fulfilment can you possibly hold
In the end of such means
Caught in the chains of enslavement
But these chains you do not know
You hold the Key to the Truth
But these chains they dull your mind

Shackled by the falsifiers
They share with you only the shadows of things
You commit to serve the mundane
Society's slave but you can not see
The Spirit so laden in the net of thorns
Entrapped by the other's spells
I speak, but you're ignorant to Me
Can you not see what you hold

They respond to the potent will
Of the Most High Standing
And being unchained by decision
Assemblage of the Ancient Way
With Incantations, manifesting our will
Expanding our Being

Why should we serve that which
betrays
Leeches, they steal of our lives
Why should we lower ourselves to the beasts
Submissive they are to be made
We need not to be held in their chains
Illusions but they can still hold
We rise within the strength
The One Who lays them to waste

Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
Punisher of the treacherous ones

This Force no bolt withstands
For It's now the Merciless One
Un-quenchable rage it holds
Only sated when the last falls
Their deed of treason
Unseen by the ones enchained
Ignorance which shielded the crimes
All seen by the All Knowing One

You'll perish within the Hands
Of the Storm that means your end
These things you call your gods
These things, they save you not

Oh now you live the torment
Bound in the chains that enslaved us
Now you feel the suffering
That you bestowed upon our being

Live the pain of the Gnashing Teeth that's
Grinding your bones enslaver
By what right did you bind us
Now you'll reap the suffering

Oh there's no mercy for you've
Broken the Sacred Laws you've
Taken the dreams of many
Lives you have bound and punished

For your crimes no repentance
Can turn back the Wrath
Which you've called on yourselves
By your deeds

No new life can arise
From a land once denounced
By my Lord
For unrivalled He stands

For no man may rise up
To enslave any other
Made free by Design of our God

That of Might shall
Define what is right
For unmatched is the Power
of Chthhulhu Most High

Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
These things you praise as gods
These things, dispirited things

You are the One, the Oldest One
You come before the legends of men
You come before the legends of gods
You are the Sea, Creator of All

You're all I need, For You I bleed
Plant Your Seed, Earth shall feed
Enlighten my soul, Spirit grows
Born of Fire, I shall return

I am the Hellspawn

Curse from my eyes, your gods I defy
Fulfillment is mine, of the Most High
Born of the Fire, I shall return
Answer the Call of the Oldest One

I am the Hellspawn

Forever I am, in Spirit I am
Forever I Dream, Continual Dream
We Sleep undisturbed again
Cthulhu We Dream in the Peace again

I am the Hellspawn

We Assemble as Those Who were
before
Of the Principal Force and Form
The Lightning Flash They are
They Breathe the Word and it becomes

We make the Covenant
To the Primal Source of which we've come
We lift ourselves
On the Path that brings us to our Dream

The Continuum Force we praise
You Slumber Being our highest goal
We make Your Way our laws
For Your Me we do decide

Deep within You Hold the Key
Being the Way
To claim the Throne that's ours by Right

Their treacherous decisions have committed them to
Eternal Dis and Torment
For now their only shield
Is the ignorance in which they hide
In the Shadows of their fears
They feel the Gnashing Teeth and Weeping

Sacred night on the Eve of May
We gather before the stars
Taste the Hunger of the Fire
Vastness of the Continuum
Heretics of a way unseen
Celebrate, the Greatest of Means
Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies
By your Hand he dies

Drink, drink, the Blood of the Ancients
Your Divine Ordering Principle is a Divine Order which manifests
Itself with Most Sweetness

Star encircled with the Power-Names
We speak in the Broken Lines
Leviathan will open the Gate
To the Great Abyssous Planes
Feel the icing winds 
Sea below all seas
Leviathan, Serpent of Truth
Share with us Most Perfect Way

Call to the Earth, fortify our will
Come Air Spirits, be our eyes this night
Primal Flames are warmth to our souls
Waters of Life, Great Blessings You pour

Calling on Leviathan
Open the gate
Link us with the Wonder of the Abyss Planes so great
Lord of the rolling thunder
Celebrate with us this night
Rip away the veil
Hear our praise

Your Slumber is our Paradise
You smite our enemies down
For we, the few enlightened
Through Your Will we break our bonds
Lord Who shatters paradigms
From the rubble the New shall rise
Your Way presents death for them
The Me-Gal-Gal we do praise

Come Centaur
Those Who Prance to the Hymns of Truth
Come join us
Come Leviathan
Make passage of the Entrance we've
Prepared for You this night

I stand before thee, gods of all pristine
Come forth to see, all things to be seen
Now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
For flock of tyrants, who know not thy path

Come now in sweeping vengeance
Come now in needed time
I demand as I stand before you
Cleanse this worlds decay

I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corrosion wiped away

And the slithering begins
As the shell of men crawl weeping
And as the light of dawn is growing
The realization sets in
And with the winds that are blowing
The final truth has come
That the ways of the shallow empty
Have brought it down
The winds that are blowing
Shall bring it down

And while your clinging
To the ways of your worthless life
Your world is falling
You are left with nothing
And with the winds that are blowing
The final truth has come
Your ways so shallow and empty
Have brought it down
Your ignorant haze
Has brought it down

Return these days to the righteous
Heal these wounds of time
I have waited so long
For the winds of change to come
Through eyes still clear
Through eyes not dulled by fear
Through eyes behind the soul
I see what must be...

I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corruption wiped away

Breathless I stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds, still I am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
(and there are other worlds than these)

Your Fathers tried to slay me
Your Brothers fell before me

Clashing, as hates collide
Through echoed cried I wade
Upon frozen ground, my victims lay

Pounding the frozen earth,
The hooves of horses carrying men
Swords raised high,
The rush of war flowing through their veins
The warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came

Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am

Heathens, they bring their crusades to me
Failing, they've come to die in vain
Nameless, their meaningfulness is none
I summon the strength of the gods
and we are one

Hear this, see this, know this
for this is the ways that it must be

For solace I eat the heart
to steal the power, this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled

Men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends, have cursed my name
spells are spoken,
believed to ward me away

Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am

Awaken my brothers,
Of vengeance we rise
To divulge this enemy,
To enlighten the ones who sleep

Worlds have passed and so too has time
My slumber now disturbed,
This place of hate, thy worlds shall burn

Humans, I shall feast upon your ignorance.
You will destroy yourselves
Mortals, your slithering existence
Sickens the gods, my brothers
It awoke me, from timeless sleep
My dreams destroyed, my visions lost
And so I watch you pray,
And spite your worlds

Forgive me father? I am not your god
You crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep,
You have fallen, curse your empty lives
Blind, like wolves you turn on yourselves

Decide, between the ways of the weak,
The sheep, to live a lie
Or to come to life, in victory we stand,
Above the meek
To raise the chalice and toast the conquering
To feast upon the spoils that we claim

We are wakening
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all is truth

We await, the coming of days
The awakening of the eyes that sleep
The dawn of light for those of us who see
To stand above the shattered flock and their lies
For now it is our time

We are the conquering
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all that is truth

Victors... now hear me
Victors...come now know your name
Brothers... as it must be
In victory we stand

Our wake, our secret is broken
Our legions now are one
The time of the silence now ended
In victory we stand
We are the conquering
The clearing out, the storm

Omniscient are the eyes that see beyond
What we choose to see
Transcending of beliefs, that limit man's being
The dogma that feeds the listless
Has thrived uncounted years
Impeding on ones perception
Of what is to be

Awaken to see
A god of a desertion
A god of lies

Enlightened by a way, deceiving
Only truth to the blind
The salvation that you seek is empty
No god of light
The venom that has fed your faith
You except with ease
But the sights that lay before you
Destroy your beliefs

Awaken to be
At One with Nothing
Now all will be seen

The seeds of the weak destroy
The lies told of forgiving, exposed
The ignorant, thrown to the wake
Your calling names of gods,
They are only shrines
The waves of the truth, enslave
Slaying the blind

Awaken to a light of knowing
All your truth was lies
And the faith which you embraced
Has left you blind
Deceived like the fools that surround you
It came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
But now you will see

These chains that have choked existence,
Have fallen away
This veil that has blinded eyes has been lifted
And now it is gone

And like the ways of the sheep
The flock has been to only receive
Led to the gates of their enemy
Led to the slaughter of their beliefs
And now their gazing eyes have turned
Turned to see us laughing

These fools who have thought
Us to be as they are,
Have never truly seen
Guided by limiting the ways that they think,
They thought us blind and obscene

But now the sheep are wailing
Cries to a god they never see
And as the gates are closing
Down upon the all they have believed
And now their pleading eyes have turned
Turned to see the eyes of the laughing

The ties have bound these fools
To the ways of the blind,
Is ignorant bliss
Lies that were fed to the slumbering mass
They've grazed upon it
And all that awaits men failing to see,
Is the sight they've despised
The gates have opened,
Your religion has died

Secured limitations
You created this thing you call sin

A guide for the undisciplined sheep
Through the pain and denial the pleasure reaped
A freedom contained within a shell
And all that's without you call hell

You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and infect you

For our ways, dishevelling your hold
And the random perplexing the fold
Behind the walls of concrete, they hide
Secured limitations
From the uncertainties, the god-mind knows
And from the nothingness, all the wines flow
The affluence, the god-mother's gift
But you can't see, through the concrete

You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and inflect you

For the heathens have chosen a different light
And the vision of the all through the inner sight
For the freedoms and prisons are in the mind
Secured limitations
From the uncertainties, the god-mind knows
And from the nothingness all the wines flow
The affluence, the god-mother's gift
But you can't see, through the concrete

I am the void of light, silence, I am the dawn of time
I am the all you see, emptiness I am the non

I am the air you breathe, treachery, I am your wine
I am the soil and seed, mundane, I am the in between

Taste of my knowledge
Come bleed me weak
Of my force feed

Drink of my power
Breathe of the mist dine upon divinity

From the earth and wind
Our return is now
Forever and now again

Our voice is one
Voice of the ancient ghosts
Now your chains are stripped away

I am the void of light, silence, I am the dawn of time
I am the soil and seed, mundane, I am the in between

Taste of my knowledge
Come bleed me weak
Dine upon divinity

From the earth and wind
Our return is now
Now the chains are stripped away

I've seen visions awakening
Drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
And I have rejoiced in them

I've heard voices calling names
I have revelled in their beckoning
For the voices that summon me
Have grown immense

My senses keen with desire and pain
Senses heightened by my need to see
To feed the hunger that I feel inside
Awake my soul to ecstasy

My father the forsaken
The king of blasphemy
They cower at your name
They live in ignorance
They hide behind a doctrine
That has taught them only lies
Now let them see
Thy world, immaculate

I've seen visions awakening
Drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
And I have rejoiced in them

I've heard voices calling my name
I have waited for their beckoning
For the voices that summon me
Bring the gift of bliss

Travesty the way the wretched stand
Upon the earth blind in their ignorance
Embracing the slavery of their minds
Soulless voids of being, left wandering

Take this blade of Elohim
Drain the life from within these fools
Release the soul, within the flesh
Saviours your name we celebrate

Forlorn, they shutter at their shrines
Tortured by Deities, they hold no relevance
Enslaved by the weakness of their minds
Their crippled prayers, have left them smothering

Seize this, The hand of our God
Drain this life the burden of these fools
Release the soul, from within the flesh
Cleanse the soul, of their lives
Cleanse the soul of impurity

Sickness Unyielding pestilence
Sickness infests the meek
Sickness bound by deities
Sickness formed by lies

Depredate, Restraint is not an option
This world has fallen, Now scorched and barren
The rage of lunatics, shall lead us nevermore
The hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now

Arise our Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom and bring your pestilence

Rectify, With haste your wrath awakened
Malfeasance, You scorn this world
Enshrined by grace, your shadow blinds the feeble
Disentail the noble few

Arise our ancient Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom destroy this wasteland
Enshrined by Grace devour this presence
Light the flame of redemption

Hollow lies fill weakened minds with
Hollow dreams
Weakened lives fill infamy with failed beliefs
Shattered wills fall aimlessly beneath the Hollow
Hollow words can't fill the void beneath

Within they seethe
Again they breed

So Callous

Legends swollen, Hallowed Waste is stripped away
The venom growing with lust to feed the Hollow need
Return from Ash, returning from a banished world
To savour flesh of the Hollow, and all beneath

Within they seethe
Again they breed

No Solace...
So Callous...
So Seething...
In this they Feast

Being has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
Vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
Substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
This very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed

Waiting to light, A dead sky aflame
To suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
This waiting it seems, for so long I've yearned to see
the burning flesh of your humanity
Your withering flesh, I've longed to see

May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burning

The Treachery Returns to the Betraying Eyes
Your Betrayers cries, fall to unyielding ears
And oh how it came to be, That you would pray to me
That you would beg to me, that this curse not come to be
That you would plead. That this curse not be released

May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burning

Remnants, From the ash arise the allegiance
Martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
Heretics, gods of the Dawning time... Vindictive

Praise this source of strength
Seize this time and heed
Embrace the strength and heed
The fallen behind me

Tyrants, stand before the task, Impeding
Mortals, In the wake of Gods, Beneath Kings
Tyranny, Fall away in shards, Demise
Leaches, Clinging to their shite, Die Blindly

Praise this Source of Strength
Seize this time and Heed
Embrace the Strength and Heed
The Fallen behind me

A way forsaking, Waste, Unhuman
Infected reason, infected being
A new time Dawning, Our time Beginning
The Reign of Leaches, it now ends...

Praise the Strength and Praise the Being
Sing these Words and Dance to Victory
Praise the Force that None can Conquer
Embrace the Strength, the Sacred Power

Praise the Strength and the Dawn Of Reckoning
See the Wrath Fall on those who Oppose This
Be One in Voice and Chant the Mantra
Feel the Force and Know Gods beyond Man

Praise the Strength, and Praise the Dawning
Embrace the Wake that Flows behind this
Grasp the Light of the New Reign Rising
Stand with Kings, Fight Undying...

Praise the Strength, And Praise the being
Sing these Words and Dance to Victory
Praise the Force that None can Conquer
Embrace the Strength

Remnants, From the ash arise the allegiance
Martyr's unforgotten lives, immortal
Tyrants, stand before the task, Impeding
Mortals, In the wake of Gods, Beneath Kings

Praise this Source of Strength
Seize this time and Heed
Embrace the Strength and Heed
The Fallen behind me

Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed

Enlightened by their Hate...
...Bathing in their Lust
...Bleeding for the taste of Revenge
The Stricken Arise

Festering deep inside manipulation
Beyond the light, the shadow's fall, this prison's hold
Awakened and growing, Beyond what eyes can see
Tasting the rebirth the Crowning of our King

Enlightened by their Hate...
...Bathing in their Lust
...Bleeding for the taste of revenge
... Thriving in their Hate
...Writhing in Disgust
...Feasting on their Weakness
We Rise...

The path of Blind Faith. The path of Idolatry.
Their path of meekness
My wrath of Sickness
My wrath of Disease
My wraths Dismantling
Hope of life

Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed

Enlighten by their Hate...
...Bathing in their Lust
...Bleeding for the taste of revenge
... Thriving in their Hate
...Writhing in Disgust
...Feasting on their Weakness

Praise Us, God of Witchery
Lord Of All Undying
Being thy blessing to thee

Now guide us, by thy hand,
Show us ways unknown by mortals
Enlist thy sight, Enlist thy will,
Free us of the undivine
Release the ways, that blind our minds,
Break apart these rusting chains
Bring the light, to wake our souls
To you we praise and speak your name

Absu Your Strength within Us
Absu Your ways Embrace
Absu Rise in Assemblance
Absu Your Will Alive

Your Presence, ornate and breathing,
Within the serpents crawl
Tried, by man as Heathens, by courts of a lesser faith
Undead, and always dreaming,
Bathed in worlds unfleshed and clean
Awake. silent and watching, through timeless life.

Raise this being to Life
Become the same as a God
Raise this being to Life
Become one with the Gods

So blessed by thee, chant the names to rise the soul
Branded, by this sacred marks, veiled in secrecy
Alive, and always dreaming,
God of our own Divinity
Rise, Your wait has ended, this time is ours

Raise this being to Life
Become the same as a God
Raise this being to Life
Becoming a God

Foulest... Beneath the Churning tide
Feeding... Upon this waste of light,
This sore of mass consumption
Lies within this, treachery,
This Undivine, conceived of hate by
Whores and slaves, in dying pain

From within this seething comes
The empty threat of the besieged
I shall never fall
I am Vengeance!!

Release these strikes of penance
Realize these words of war
Unfold these minds emotion
Release this wrath within haste
Bring this fate upon these men who choose to be
At one with the cowardice within thine enemy

From within this seething comes
The empty threat of besieged
I shall never fall
I am Vengeance!!

Decimate your allegiance
Decimate your inner strength
Kneel before me and learn your fate
Know your master,
Chant my name

Cowards...
Engulfed in ignorance
Kneel before me and learn your fate
Know your master,
Chant my Name

Release these strikes of penance Realize these words of war
Unfold these minds emotion
Release this wrath within haste
Bring this wrath upon these men who choose to be
At one with the cowardice within thine enemy

They've come to bring us gift
They've come to make us whole
They've come to give us God
Their gift of Heaven
They've come to make us civil
Their gifts as ransom
Their God comes with a cost
We must give up all

For prayers in a foreign tongue
To a foreign throne

Erase our traditions
Erase our way of being
Erase our elder's teachings
Erase, replace these ways
Generations of wisdom
In exchange for ransom
Your God comes with a cost
A cost to us all

Prayers in a foreign tongue to
A God unknown
From demons, you will never see
Prayers that will save your soul
Blessed are the children
We have come to save them all

We came to cure disease that
Has never made you ill
We came to make you clean,
To protect you from yourself

They've come to bring us hope
They've come to save our souls
They've come to make us holy
They've come to give us Heaven
They've come to make us civil
Just like them
Their God comes with a cost
And we must give up
All of our traditions
Erase our way of being
Erase our elder's teachings
Erase, replace these ways
Generations of wisdom
They have taken away
Our culture has been erased

Bring every child they blessed
With the needle's mark
Chop off every little arm
Let the children bleed

Shards of broken machinery
Gears dislodged and flailing
Flesh gives steel no challenge
Bones cannot withstand
Blades will smash resistance
Chains will drive the hunting of the flesh

Slick through the skin straight to the soul
Leaving no breathing man alive
Kill them all

Knock down their walls, flatten their homes
Leaving no place for the humans to hide
Kill them all

Burn every bridge
Scorch every crop in case one survives
Kill them all

Burn every one
Grind their bones to dust
Mere flesh cannot withstand us
We have come to wipe this planet clean
To end your consumption
Mere flesh cannot withstand me
I've come to wipe this planet clean
To clean to burn to grind

Blades will smash resistance
Chains will drive the hunting of the flesh

No God will claim this garden
Too sickening to the eyes to see this
Long ignored my words of warning
From the world I built, erased
So it shall know no peace in my time

In absence of my voice for guidance
In the absence of my hand and whip
Grew the absence of the knowing
Unknowing
Grew the absence and grew the festering
A boiling abscess that
Was sure to burst with failure

From a distance I have observed
Minding my slaves like children
Absorbing your petty struggles
Disgusted by your petty lives
I have witnessed your sleight of hand
I was betrayed by you many times
I have craved to bring forth my vengeance
I have yearned to dismantle this

World of unfathomed treasures
This garden disgraced by man
Your ways despised by beasts and gods alike
All gods agree your ways must end
They have waited long to see this
You claim to not need my guidance

Yet you reach for my hand and plead
Obsessed with your futile struggles
You are mistaken to think I feel
From a distance I have observed
Minding my slaves like children
Absorbing your petty strife
Disgusted by your petty life

All gods have left this garden
These gods have left in shame
Dismissed and long forgotten
This world of useless being
This endless festering

Kingdoms infamous for taking as they please
To appease a voice of righteousness
Infidels and heretics, enemies of our light
Shall be dealt with in the name of God
It is the rite of our kind to silence any tongue
That would try to oppose the king of our land

Bring us their heads as trophies of our victories
Praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
Foretold by ancient prophets
Bring us new lands, these people too will praise us

Praise our God or meet your own
It matters not to us, we have glory either way
Bow down before our king
Fear is your new faith, fear is your new doctrine
Be docile until we say, be ready with your life
If the king needs you to die

Bring us their head as trophies of our victories
Praise us and align as soldiers of a destiny
Foretold by ancient prophets
Bring us new lands, these people too will praise us

The followers of ancient ways shall be taught to follow us
Or be beaten to their fate
The kingdom does not accept any praise of other lands
It will be treated as an act of war
You exist because we allow it, so kneel to show your God
It is us that you fear

Prepare to learn the ways of this new kingdom
Prepare to swear your soul and life to keep it
Prepare to give yourself to do our bidding
Prepare to sacrifice for our desire

With swipe of hand release disease
Exonerate their thoughts of gods
At odds with what they see
With slam of fist to flesh of earth
Discharge your breath of
Molten poison, scorch their lungs

I am all prophecies fulfilled
Yet you refuse too see this
You mock my name, have you forgotten?
I am the truths that were lost, taught
As myths and buried in earth
The soil won't hide the warning signs

My art, to bring demise
My skill, it is necessity
My will, exists through time
It's my rite, to rid this world of life

My presence means demise
I relinquish kings of power
My course to disassemble life
To embellish while you cower
I am proof that all denied, was scripted
For all to know this
Thus all who closed their eyes
Will pray now to have witnessed this

With abandon, they have tarnished
In ignorance they devour
Consumed by the lust of owning all
Their slavery, their bliss
They are repulsed by the gifts we have given
They cannot hold them in their hands
These fools have felt unsettled
Shall stay and watch it as it burns

I am the architect
It is my design to betroth this earth
You called my name
Have you forgotten?
I am the builder of all loss
I am the keeper at all cost
The soil, the air, are my creations
And I shall watch them burn

I am the architect
I am the un existence
You know my name!
You have not forgotten!
I am creator of this world
I am the keeper of the soil
The soil won't hide
The warning signs

I am all prophecies fulfilled
Yet you refuse to see this
You mock my name
I have not forgotten!
I am the truths that were lost,
Taught as myths and buried in earth
The soil, the air, are my creations

To amend any treasons of the truth
Or of the soul
We the gods of all things share witness
So be it the law
That any being beneath our skies shall
Know our mercy when it is earned
And shall know the wrath of the gods
When it is deserved
Now we decide
These feeble yet volatile human beings have menaced
Beyond what is acceptable
Their yearning to self consume in misery
Has made them every bit expendable
Their reasoning brings questions of their
Understanding, their truth is anything
But logical and I suspect that the facts
Will show beyond a doubt, the evidence is clear to see

I share your hatred and I share in your disgust
I second the motion, beyond a doubt, they are expendable to us
Release all demons of the underworld, release the wrath of all our kin
Release the demons beneath the soil, let this cleansing now begin

Now come our fury upon this world
Now come to bring upon them endless night
Resolve this land of these succubi
These humans, this burden

Hypocritical guidance has confused the masses
Veiling the instinctive nature of a higher cause
Accumulation and consumption
Evaluated by your possessions
Unabated cleansing of a deeper being

Dissociative dissent, liberation through ignorance
Disseminate devolution, dissipation of disruption
Isolation and dejection, disenchanted exhilaration
Discomposed reverence, subservient

Constant denial of truth
Constant distrust
Constant obedience

This has spawned a new type of human
Who live in fear and addiction
Lead them
Guide them to extinction

Gone is the will, gone is the time, the ways of the righteous
Again we will never see them
Gone is the strength, gone is the courage, to deny these treasures
Gone is the way of every king

To no kings have we prayed
To no kings do we bow down
To no prayers do we yield our cleansing
Your gods rejoice in your end

Hear us sing
Of man in eulogy
Mocking the gods and their heresy
In glory of how it soon will be
Mourning no gods, for they will know defeat

Gone is their pride, gone is their hate, gone is every witness
Gone is the need to decide
Gone is all life, gone is the tumor that is human being
Gone is the need for their gods

With no gods do we feast
From no gods do we cower
No prayer will yield our cleansing
This fate no god would change

Bring before me anyone who opposes my name
Bring before me any voice that speaks in disdain of me
Bring before me any force that would challenge my will
Bring before me every vessel that is filled with doubt

Erase them from my kingdom
We have no way to feed them
Burn down every home that keeps them safe at night
Rape them as you wish their daughters
Feed the wolves their mothers, erase them
Make sure that every father sees his son die, before he bleeds
Erase them and let the kingdom see it

Erase them
Take the gold and burn the rest
Torture any fool that does not submit
Erase them
Have them swear devotion, then cut out their tongue
Torture any fool that does not submit
Make them believe in this

Empires and nations fall, Caesars were men not gods
Idols change as needed through time
Generals are irrelevant without war
Kings mean nothing without fools
To master
To feed their manic ego
To win their lusted plights
To follow with no caution
To follow to demise

Mad men are praised and worshipped
Enslavers victimize
Torture, always their answer
To teach incessant hatred

The hand of God became filled with riches for only kings
The hand of kings became the will of men enslaved

Our darkest days have come
Barbaric rules, self-serving
Abandoned hope of gods
Dismissed and long forgotten
Our fate cannot be seen
Prophetic fools have failed us
Their visions long dispelled
They've fallen, like all idols

We demand a victor's feast
We demand that all shall know thee
We demand your end be praised

Destroy all statues standing
Built before you reign
Tear them down in your name
Disregard all existence
All kings before your time
They shall all be erased
You claim to desire peace
But if the truth be seen
You know us as your enemy

The ones that praise your grace
The fools that claim your glory
Will watch the pillars fall
And see your kingdom burn
You called us impure heathens
You mocked our culture's ways

You forced disbelief upon us
By way of sword and blade
You ruled with hand of fury
You pillaged and you raped
None shall sing your praise
They claimed you as their savior
Embraced your heinous ways
You proved yourself a failure
You swore to be the shelter
To shield is from the storm
Yet, you brought this reign upon us
A shattered ego fallen
Dismissed and soon forgotten
Your name will be erased
We always were your enemy
And if the truth be seen
We brought your end of days
Praise no man as savior

Will the love of god shed its grace
Upon the evil side of man
Symbolic throne begins to tarnish
Poisoned with impurity
Clouds of darkness start to thicken
Dominate the tranquil skies
Frigid earth devoid of light begins to rot and die

Angels fall their wings decayed
Their hymns of praise sung from the graves
Unspoken prayers cease to comfort
The objects of his rage...

Into everlasting fire

Judgment passed now conclusive
The appalling truth reveals itself
Our tragic end was procured
By our own deceitful ways
Once created in his image
Now destroyed in his fury
A disregard for our lives
His people now condemned

Denouncement of all who've sinned
Their blackened hearts ripped from their chests
Forgiving god exalted high
Please forgive our sins!

Into everlasting fire

Blessed in life... Flourish in death
Children of god... Destitute
Embrace of love... Loses hold
Bond of trust... Misconceived
Tears erupt... Fall to hell
Caressed by fear... We die as one

Mourners of a dying world
Too late to reconcile
Into everlasting fire
Can't you see it's Satan's world?

Slaughtering the innocent
Massacring the weak

Intimidate their fearful minds
Corrupt their structurer world

Afflict with terror, their lives suppressed
Consuming all their hopes

Expurgate their thoughts, oppressing all
Nauseate with fright

Hollowed shells of living corpses
Pay homage to their art

Frail and weak, despondent souls
Are prematurely dead...

Cherished hopes beyond your grasp
Trepidation grows within
Time exists to test your brain
Tormenting fast your sanity
Dormant lives are cast aside
Evil slaughter, vile and sick
...Feel the pain!

Deep below... Damp and cold
Chambers filled... With rotting dead
Sealed together... Cryptic cells
Twisted corpses... In a mangled grave
Maggots grow... Deep inside
Multiply... Savored feast
Concealed to all... Unknown their fate
Plea for life... Their cries obscure

Slaughtering the innocent
Massacring the weak

Intimidate their fearful minds
Corrupt their structurer world

Afflict with terror, their lives suppressed
Consuming all their hopes

Expurgate their thoughts, oppressing all
Nauseate with fright

Hollowed shells of living corpses
Pay homage to their art

Frail and weak, despondent souls
Are prematurely dead...

Cherished hopes beyond your grasp
Trepidation grows within
Time exists to test your brain
Tormenting fast your sanity
Dormant lives are cast aside
Evil slaughter, vile and sick
...Feel the pain!

Awaiting messiah
To save us from sin
A second hope
His reign begins
Born of virgin
To conquer mankind

Deity from hell
Satan divine...

Christ possessed
I am born...

Twist of scripture
Christ possessed
Come forth with wrath
Evil obsessed
Hatred and war
Sadistic spell
Swallows the earth
Thanks be to hell

Christ possessed
The dawn has come...

Praise the day the Christ child is born
Born of woman to evil he's sworn
To rule mankind like no other before
Unholy throne Christ adore

Arise in flames... I am born
I rule with fury... I rule with scorn
Evil will conquer... And forever will be
Bleed in pain... Kneel to me

I lifted my soul joyfully
If not my life will end painfully
Extol he who rides above the clouds
Majestic and glorious
Reigning victorious

Exalted to his name
Far above the earth
But below is where I’ll see
Unmoved by your praise
Seated in splendor

High above the heavens
Resounding out his name
Far below are my beliefs

Your majestic light shines down upon me
I turn my face... And shut my eyes
For your light casts darkness upon my world
A world I’ve not chosen... To dwell within
For those who judge me by your standards

Say I’m unworthy... Of your grace

Enthroned upon their praise
Dethroned with my disgust
Unworthy of your glory
You turn your back on me

You are Jesus
You are lord
Imperfect god
You are nothing to me
For this you say
I'll burn for all eternity...

Jesus Christ
You are lord
You are god
But have you won ever sin and death
Victory's crown shall be ours
For we are those
Those you've left behind

Digression to an unknown fear mortified
Soul embraced in a darkened gasp path to hell
Infiltrate the weakened mind succumb to death
Waste away convulse in pain dissolve within...

Twisted brains decays
Abstract world or pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Bodily entombed... Beckons internal grave
Paralyzed with fear... Internal decadence

Submit to parasitic thoughts drown in a mental haze
Extraction from reality feelings now devoured
Dimension in hell rotting mind wastes away
Desire life fade away suffer endlessly...

Twisted brains decays
Abstract world or pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Exiled from sanity... Never to return
Mental paralysis... Internal decadence

Twisted brains decays
Abstract world or pain
Anguish of the mind
Tortured afterlife

Noble ones perverse
Fulfilment of their lusts
Seeking innocence
To satiate their needs
Children for their pleasure
Abducted from the world
Adopted into hell
Punished for their births

(Circle of) manias

Rules of their existence
Insane immortal laws
Desires are forbidden
Lusting for their flesh
Sickened evil minds
Manipulate to death
One hundred and twenty days
Sodom redefined

(Circle of) excrement

Kneel down before the lords
And taste the filth awaiting you

A noble feast for those enslaved
Enticing vows of defilement

Unholy palace of perversion
Embellished with depravity

Embrace your life for now
It slips away

(Circle of) blood

Commencement of their final trial
Upon their final day

Trembling naked figures slowly
Marched into the courtyard

Tender flesh is seared and ripped
Tides of blood released

The masters watch in ecstasy
The orgies of the damned

A sacred ground of tragic deaths
Breeding decomposition

Spirits rising from the dead
Seeking retribution

Abandoned futures never seen
By those of youth and innocence

Inevitable demise
The circle now is sealed

War has evolved in a world bound for death
Trails of blood
Lead to our corpses
Liquids of life have taken to the earth...

Man destroying humanity
A world made of shit! Now in endless pain...

Man destroying the earth!

War has evolved in a world bound for death
Trails of blood
Lead to our corpses
Liquids of life have taken to the earth...

Man destroying man

I pray that I can see
Beyond this life tormenting me
Tempting from inside
Come hysteric thoughts of pain
Slowly I'm consumed
Into emptiness I fall
When my body's cold and dead
Will the feelings be the same?
Will my kingdom comfort me?
Of reject my languid soul

Stagnant cooling blood
Starts to coagulate
My body weakens and sinks
As my soul discorporates

Resurrected from the souls of the damned
Comes the fury of their dismay

Ungodly images unveiled to me
Creations from below
My body rot within its grave
My soul now free to roam

I begin to seek
What's been taunting me
My lifeless corpse
No longer binding me

My incarnate life no more
My existence now deceased
Now that I am gone
I exist in misery
My unpleasant realization
And my suffering begins
Salvation never reached
And my kingdom never found

Stagnant cooling blood
Starts to coagulate
My body weakens and sinks
As my soul discorporates

Resurrected from the souls of the damned
Comes the fury of their dismay

Ungodly images unveiled to me
Creations from below
My body rot within its grave
My soul forever roams

Miles away the dead are left
Quarantined contain the death
Brought to man a gift from hell
Infectious blood devours all

Filtered through your blood it flows
Your icy corpse frozen glance
Rapid spreading unrelenting plague
We're sucked into its realm

Infected flesh... Peels
Through your face... Falls
Falls to the ground... Rots
Rots in the heat... Burns
Burns away

Vomit blood into your hands
Hemorrhaging internally
Organs breaking through your skin
Slow decay from within

Silent screams are never heard
Echo through the fields of dead
Doomed to face a painful end
Alone to die where you fall

Bodies now are thrown
Onto a pile decay
A common grave for all
Infect the populace
All behold the dead
Rest eternally
Now condemned to die
Eradicates our race

Ablaze in fire corpses burn
Upon a mound of flesh
Cleansed in flames this rampant plague
Crimson blood so pure

Infected flesh... Peels
Through your face... Falls
Falls to the ground... Rots
Rots in the heat... Burns

Feasts on the flesh of innocents killed
A sacrifice to our lord
A sign from below to slaughter and kill
All in the name of hell
A circle of fury that starts in hell
And ends with the race of man
Our blood seeps deep into the soils of the earth
Feeding the evil within
Religious fool cry to your savior
Bargain with your sins
The efforts of god proven useless
Immolation now begins...

Disemboweled... Desecrate
Death divine... Morbid fate
Creeping pestilence... Spreads with hate

Horrid cries of agony and pain
Butchered beyond reason
Our corpses are left in heaps of blood
Piled up to the heavens
Impotent redeemer falls from heaven's grace
An idol no more
King of hell reclaims his throne
Barbaric in his bliss
Holy priest hold high your cross
Our fate you try to save
Pawns of death rejoice in glory
Lead us to our graves...

Dogma crumbles... Carnage is cast
Misery plague... Forgotten our past
Wrath of hell... Forever will last

Heaven defied
Christ denied
Evil desire
We'll burn in fire

Die in the pentagram
Where you'll be slaughtered
Immolate your soul
In the name of...

Cowards, with your empty hearts
And narrow minds...So bitter
Your confusion is overwhelming
So aimless and misguided
Your search for a higher power
Something better than yourselves
In a perfect world, your perfect god
Is a coward just like you

Watch them gather, they flock together
For in numbers they feel strength
Will you find your way to paradise,
Through the darkness within your light
To the children, they feed his body
Peel his flesh from off the cross
In his blood they'll wash away
All the dirt from their souls

Obedient young, they'll join the flock
With minds like clay and hearts so pure
Fill them with his words and fears
And feed them to the waiting beast

His open arms and splendid brilliance
Devours those who can not see
The dimming light from high above
Vanquished by their higher coward

How can you glorify and praise
One so weak, imperfect and insane
The magnitude of his madness is so clear
In the eyes of the herd that he keeps

Look what you have become
Just another like all the rest

Bless me father
For you've sinned against me
It's been one week
Since you've raped me

Holy Father, your spirit inside me
Holy Father, robbed my virtue
Holy Mary, mother of Christ
The fruit of thy womb has poisoned me

Father, you're not a father
Rapist, selfish taker of youth
The fires you cast out
I promise you for eternity

Our father who aren't in heaven
Inside of me, my soul is lost
My manhood, so miniscule, was stolen
The Rosary has gripped tight around my neck
I hailed Mary...Over and over again
You've failed Mary
You've raped Mary...Over and over again
You've walked beside me, but I was alone
You've walked on top of me, crushing me

My innocence and my emotions
Were wiped away and you didn't care
You just hid behind your collar
The hardest time, I was helpless
And it was too late, much too late

Touch me I'm warm, but not alive
Feel my hot breath, but I'm not living
Dead inside, Alone forever
Father why...Father why

Father, you're not a father
Rapist, selfish taker of youth
The fires you cast out
I promise you for eternity

Son of highest
You are falling
You are falling
Not floating from out of the sky
You deceive us
You betray us
You will not lift our hearts to eternity
But leave a hole with despair

We waited and waited
Our crosses born
And still you did not come

And how does it feel
As life passes by
We will not know until we pass
That you are a lie

Will we receive the mark
Of those who did not believe
The temptations that are burning us alive
But you tell us that there's sin in what we think
For forgiveness we'll believe your every word
But will you show us what our souls cry out to see

No...No...No...
Son of man, are you the son of God
No...No...No...
Did you die to cleanse this world of sin
No...No...No...
Will you return from the dead to
Save the world again
No...No...No...
Has the blood you shed turned the darkness into light...No

Son of highest
You are falling
You are falling
Not floating from out of the sky

We waited and waited
Our crosses born
And still you did not come

Messiah or man
To me you gave this bloodied crown
And with it came such tragic folly
Such strong devotion from those so weak

Lend me your soul...I'll fill it with fear
Carry you high to where you can see
The fall that awaits, so inviting and cold
From this high place we'll fall below

In death I am born
From man to God
Through blindness
Your suffering

Forced upon this cross...High above in shame
Forced upon this pedestal...High above the blame

Your blood holds my kingdom high
A kingdom built on fear and lies
So sour has this bread and wine become
For I am not a God, a martyr or a king

I've bled as you bleed
I've cried as you cry
I've sinned as all of you
I've died, as you will too
But I see through your blindness
And I wait for your fall
Resurrected by your faith
But I'll never walk this world again

Hang me high above all and nail me to forever
Never let me fall from this highest of places

Take your heaven
And your hell
And leave them for the children
I refuse to believe these lies

Show me you're real
Prove your greatness
Can you show me that you really loved us
That you really died to save us from damnation
I don't think you can, I don't think you will

Divine illumination sees no path to forgiveness
When the one who defies the lord is cast out forever

Banishment from the house of God is not what I fear
For his kingdom is divided and his people shall stray

I commend myself for this unpardonable sin
For now more than ever I see clearer than before

One above, how mighty are your wonders
Your kingdom is everlasting, yet so empty
Your saints have chosen sin over glory
Your strength has diminished...My fallen one

The misery that surrounds me, I'm repulsed by your name
Your image has brought despair to the ones you've forsaken
Your death I'll rejoice as your sickness disappears
Lament in your own failure, for in death there is rebirth

I commend myself for this unpardonable sin
For now more than ever I see clearer than before

Lay your hands...Your healing hands
Upon my flesh...My sinful flesh
And heal this soul...My tormented soul
For I am lost within this place

The light I've seen for my entire life
Won't guide my way...It's failing me
You're failing me...And soon I'll see
That with your death this passion dies

My devotion to you was complete
I've carried the weight of your cross
The burden of life presses me
These nails are in too deep
My passion suffocates me
Jesus you suffocate me

Help me down
From my cross
I'm dying here
My faith it fades
I've suffered long
My passion

Lost in prayer
I lost my soul
Lost my way
I followed you
You led me deep
Into despair
Where there was hope
Gloom was waiting

My devotion to you was complete
I've carried the weight of your cross
The burden of life presses me
These nails are in too deep
My passion suffocates me
Jesus you suffocate me

I know this is my chosen path
To believe in no one but me
I know this is my chosen path

You've always kept the promise
You've always kept the faith
Well I never will and never had to

I've sinned and sinned
I've sinned and I will again

According to your higher standards
For this I'll go to hell
You hypocrite, you never did

Your truths are lies
Your lies are so pathetic
I'll never give up my soul for you

I've sinned and sinned
I've sinned and I will again

To you I am darkness
To you I have no soul
The smoke from these flames
Will rise up forever

Put my hand in the fire
Put my head in the flames
I can believe
I know it hurts
My skin is melting
I know it's real
My skin is melting
And it feels so right

To you I am darkness
To you I have no soul
The smoke from these flames
Will rise up forever

Silent is the storm that awaits
As our crumbling world starts to give way
Falling around us a new kingdom rises
Billions of souls sinking and sinking

The flames from below dance at our feet
Soon to rise up and carry us through
The burning gates ablaze in glory
Marvel at the fall of man

Glorious flames...Rise above
Show us pain...And cleanse our world

Our selfish eyes see no wrong
Closer and closer to God we believe
But farther and farther from grace we'll fall
Closer and closer to our kingdom of fire

Comfort us with words of hope
We stare into the coming dark
Blanket us with eternal night
The sweetness of death upon our lips

Far are we...From everlasting joy
Close are we...To a world below

A world of hate...A world of pain
A world too blind to see
A world of judgments...A world of sadness
A world void of truth
A world of the power mad...A world of corrupted lives
A world destroying itself ahead of its time
A world of lust...A world of greed
A world with no hope

Bastard son, you spread your arms to save us from ourselves
This weak attempt has failed us so, just like your fabled father above
This shadow you've cast upon our world still conceals the light
So pick a God, for there's no one left that can save us from our end

We'll beg for life
We'll beg for forgiveness
We'll beg for pity
We'll beg to be closer to God
Foolish souls will never see
The closer to God the closer to our end
For Christ can't undo this sorrow and pain
For when he died his soul went below

Glorious flames...Consume us all
Bring us closer...To a God below
Far are we...From everlasting joy
Close are we...To a world below

Goat horned god of plagues
In thy name I carve my flesh
I wish to be reborn!

Cast your darkness so I can see the light
Let it perforate my soul
the sun will set no more...

Lay me down on the bed of death
Allow me to return redeemed
Quench my thirst with vigorous bile
Bestow upon me hate

Hostis Humani Generis

Purge the earth from human pest
Manifestation of satanic might
Spit forth thy utmost wrath
An epitome of doom!

Morbid paroxysm leads to despair
Insanity springs eternal
Lucidity fades to its demise...

Disintegration of the soul
To the existential void

Sanity ordains me not
A servant of paramount chaos
On perpetual orbit in the cosmos

Wrecks of vanishing faith
Long lost herd of self-deceitful
Entrapped in pseudo morality
Sanctimonious disciples of blatant hypocrisy

Sin after sin, you commit
Yet hide int he veils of repentance,
only to sin again!
You repulse me...

Terminate... the bigotry

I assail your paltry messiah
I deflower the immaculate whore
I invert your symbols of worship
For I am the envoy of Satan!
The dry heads of the young ones
Staring at me await the hour,
Mouths halted mid-scream
Eyes black with death

A golden tooth beneath each tongue
Adorned by sings obscure
A body of weeds beneath each wreck
Ritually prepared and bound

In the lamp's flickering light
I stare them in the eye
Shadows dance their faces
Their gaze returns mine

Demons howling backwards
Trees move in the breeze
My mind starving for reason
When with one voice they speak

Rotted bones turn in earth:
while eye almighty gazes
Sealed behind its lid
bound by triangular coffin.

Rotted bones turn in the earth
beetles crawl undivine tissue

Soil shifts by movement
remnant seeks another ---

A predator's decayed wing
decorates foreign torso
A lion's claws, old horns of ox
& a manlike face rises monstrous

fourfold immortality rid of life
Debased in mortal graves
In a shameful uprising rejoined

Fourfold immortality rid of life,
fourfold renunciation of death
fourfold blasphemy of death.

Denying their father once holy:
on arbitrary anatomy
This hideous mass rises

Soul and flesh segregated in a quest
Baptized in raven's blood
Prolific entities vegetating --- longing for
The revival of our father Satan

We are subdued

Glance of desire
Towards what was once needed
Now that all got obtained, used and consumed
Lack of hope force-fed
Energy tuned into fire.

Starving, craving, feeding
the endless process

Curving, forcing, bleeding
Sins never confessed

Glorification of other
Icon revealed through needs
Icon eaten, swallowed
Turning the outside into inside
Vortex of fire
Vortex of will
Vortex of power

Make me whole
Let the rise reach its peak of transcendency
Go through mind conspiracy
My own soul private enemy

Teeth in flesh, red deep
Dead on the floor
Your lord consumed by rats
Twenty hundred years now
Why the fuck can't you forget him?

Eating His flesh
And drinking His blood
I pray for total death

Ripping my throat apart with my hands
Screaming in madness and gargling in blood
Breaking my fingernails peeling my skin off
A perfectly choreographed self hypnosis ritual

Reality fades as eyes become white
Chants are sung backwards and louder
Red velvet soaked in blood drowns the words that were written
Figures come forth from the waves on the wall

A tongue of fire slithers down my head
Burning all that is conscious and real
And enlightens me until ashes and faith remain

What I see shall be only ornaments for the Lord
What I speak shall be praise and truth of the Lord
What I build shall become tomb for the weak and the innocent
And they will vanish, never to sow their anaemic seed again

Your Kingdom ultimately collapsed
Splendor decayed by your own decrepitude
Muttered lamentations, the hopelessness of hope
Imminent submission
The Fallen Angel is rising...

Pieces of flesh cover this desert
Cursed place that hope never reached
Doglike demons sweep across the land
Where only thorns grow to shape Christ's crown
Rivers of blood nourish the jewels of the leper king

Ribald memorial shining like fires
Shadows whisper of the thing that was forever here
Menial creatures swarm towards this damnation
To be devoured by the beasts of light

Body parts spread all around this tower
Where only legends and memories live
Of lust for carnal resurrection

Sacrificed to feed the worms
And to keep the earth warm
Under this dead pile
The soil is alive
And skin is growing,
Taking our master's final form

Mark of suffocation
The depths antecedent ooze
Omniscience
Quintessence maligned

Husks discarded lurk
Neath starless pools
Cracked molds, the broken shells
Of Excremental design

Disembodied abolition
In sands preceding time
Fossils of abortion
The slough of autochthon

Smashed fragments
Menace even in the acknowledgment
Of their existence
Spiny thoughts to pierce

The very membranes they sustain
The delicate untruth
Quagmire of pre existence
Where no separateness lies

Husks discarded lurk
Neath starless pools
Cracked molds, the broken shells
Of Excremental design

Shades were riding the winds
Towards me, to fill my lungs
Snakes unreel from my hair
As walls crawl closer

Image blurs, stirring cauldron
Suffocating black fumes
Immaculate poison
Descent to maddening silence
Entering this sleep
Dreamless deathlike sleep

Shades were riding the winds
Towards me, fill my lungs
Snakes unreel from my hair
As walls crawl..., crawl... closer

Never to return
Locked inside
Abyss Eternal

Tentacles rising
From the surface
of the subconscious

Immense cliffs of flesh
To satisfy his lust
Forever nailed alive
Nevermore fucking Christ.

Black waves drowning the horizon
Ocean swallows ocean -
Earth and spirit flushed away
As reason disintegrates

Black waves drowning the horizon
Hounds leap forth from the waters
Each of them tearing at the throat
While waves wash the body

Black waves drowning the horizon
Admire the beauty of fear
Love the star in the dog's eye
House of the soul falls to the waves

Black waves drowning the horizon
Overwhelming roar of elements
Wading waist-deep into fright
Plunging into infinity

Black waves drowning the horizon
A flickering light in the depths
Sea vomits body ashore
followed by one who walks upright

And from within the black lungs of desire
Your betray, as you always did, yourself
From within the lungs of desire
You betray yourself once more
And that which you worshipped as god.

Death never whispered your name
in the shadows
Not out of fear, Not because you won
but to punish and humiliate you
The one who didn't ever deserve to die
The absolute nothing...
Cursed to live, desiring to end.
Cursed to live, desiring to end.
Cursed to end...

On my knees I scream and beg you
To perpetuate the schism
With the world of fraud and pain

Forget all your children
You so deliberately deceived
and lied to
As you walk away, the tears you cry
Will be our Holy Communion

Worthless Father

And we will laugh...
And spit at you...
As you leave,
Never consider looking back at us.

The tears you cry
Will be our Holy Communion
And with it to celebrate your final...
...and TRUE DEATH.

Worthless Father

Blood and ashes
Riddle of clay
From the shoulder of Man
And the womb of the whore

Image of god reversed
Eyes look inside
Holding the book
Where all pages are void

Nothing is true
Chaotic maze
Forms are dissolved
Withered by Death

Deep in the black earth
Planting the seed,
With larvae and worms
To create the negative

Torch of truth
A burning bush
The only light
Archaic knot

Blood and ashes
Riddle of clay
From the shoulder of Man
And the worms of the whore

An answer with no question
An end without beginning
Eye of Satan
Lock and the key

Forced into your mind, passed down through the centuries
Cultures will collide, holy wars for what?
Holy book of god, holy book of lies

Chanting scriptures in vain
Hoping to allow to rest
Hopeful peaceful life
Compassion all but gone
Effigy of what's to come
Hopeless, worthless dreams
Sorrow scars your brain
End the weak, all is dead

Come see, my light
Misguided fools, I shall guide
Grant thyself, all your minds
Liege of inveracity

Follow still you will
Puppets to take your lord
Only gaining faith for
An imminent demise
Reduce your wretched mind
With these false prophecies
Now I will prevail
All servants left to rot

A new race I will now create
As I end their pitiful lives
My destiny has only begun
To torture future minds

Torn away from my state of being
Chosen to be forgotten
Unspeakable pain as I leave this solid structure
As the earth becomes smaller, I reach a new plane
One so distant from where I was conceived

A heaping mass of fear is what we hold dear
For our loved ones who go to this heaven
Thrown away even by god
Sentenced to this celestial cell

How can life after death be more serene than life itself?
God has nothing to offer this decaying world
All he will give is eternal misery
How can life after death be more serene than life itself?

Effigy of the forgotten

How can you cry when someone dies?
The lord will greet him
With open arms, that's what he wrote
I will never believe them
Victims of deception, forward to regression
I must defy him

Exhume the wretched body from its timeless slumber
Thrashing the tomb to reveal what's inside
A maggot-infested corpse stares dismal
Inhabited by worms chewing holes through your carcass

These ancient lands beckoned the burial of humans
The unfertile soil infecting the crypts
Of the once deceased bodies not through decomposure
Ending their peace, their chances of hell

A vomit-type substance is formed from its innards
A festering slime that revels inside

The substance erupts and its stomach bursts open
Forced down your throat to regurgitate life

Lies, deceitful words of impatience
Futile words of evasion

The gods that have once spoken to me
Have abandoned me to my pre-destined state
A state in which there are no words, is no language
Only the language of the endless suffering

Suffering that brings me to appreciate my new found existence
One that spawns forth a new being
A being in which there is no appreciation for his fellow man
to see
Hatred and remorse unto those who have punished me
Punishment too cold to see
I don't see, I don't see
One that I have once created
Forced to change, I don't need

The path of abomination of all things

For I am now a seed, that will one day set forth a new race
One that will cleanse my soul
Anticipation of the weak-minded fools

One that my once beloved gods will not recognize

Race which feeds off the suffering
As the mortals cry out their new found god

The race grows strong
Until the day
The day of judgment

The race grows strong
Until the day

Pray in homage under shadows of ancestry
Conceptual lords above bathing in your inquiry
Memorizing thoughts through hallucinations of despair
Imminence burns within, plunge yourself to disrespect
Battered visions, desolation drips into your eyes
A feeling of oppressiveness that vastly clutters life
Deviation scarred within, placed upon you from your birth
Engage with destitution, as it rips into your mind

Morally detrimental
Incapacitated existence
Ignorant false worship

Exit all that's insincere
Rendered never to believe, never to place trust again
Deny the cross you bear
Resisting all religion, resisting infirmities
Habitual infamy
Malignant infatuation
Reduces your will to live
Illusive reality
Images shred your mind to pieces
Deception crowds you
An infection of thoughts that god is there for you
Condemnation
Self-inflicted betrayal provoked by others

Sink in deep depression
States of mental turmoil
Abdication enters
Sanity depletes
Paralyzing conflicts
Fear of retribution
Catastrophic frenzies
Burns within your mind

Sifting through delusions
Comatose with anguish
Tribulation drowns all hope
To live on

Purge your soul in hate
You're realizing you can't afford
Brace yourself til all resistance ends
Cut yourself and release the blood

Cremate the human race
The population has been reduced
A world condemned to horrid death
And the blood of others heeds their savior
An artificial homicide
The strong and feeble, all will die
Nothing left to say
Warmongers have to pay

Re-cremation!

Bodies rise up from the ground
Twice as twisted as before
Turning the life that we know how
To the one with knowledge but no laws
Legal butchery will destroy this so called structure
We want the ones with life
Let's begin the mass cremation

Genetic bonds are broken
Flesh ripped and torn
Look what's become of you
Will you ever meet your maker?
No, you'll suffer til demise
To the ones with knowledge
Primitive actions will suffice
Tied down to the altar, we begin the sacrifice

Rancid death completes self-immolation
Your organs re-designed
Your brain's been under siege since you died
False life has taken over

Warfare, a promise to eliminate mankind
The planet as we know it, taken by demented minds
Warheads produced to exterminate the earth
This sacrifice will lead us to our death, no rebirth

No one has the power to declare this world to die
Voting and electing the right to crucify
Times of turmoil have decided what to do
No need for common knowledge, we're through

World explosion
Mass obliteration
...of a race

Forced to live here day by day through day by day
We dread the fear of living in the afterworld spirits of the dead
Thoughts of nuclear holocaust that drive our world insane
Women and children forced and left to kill

Through daily hibernation, manage to survive
Sifting through, they must be found, extinction we provide

Purify - the unholy land
Extinction - the so called master race
Crucify - the preachers of this hate
Liquefy - the minds of those they create

Nocturnal demon of hate
Searching for his next prey
Predator with no remorse
Cannibalistic killing machine

Attacking with demise, something to realize
Stripped of your life, you'll see, that it's too late
To save your fate, trembling of what's to come
He'll testify, then crucify, as you die in vain

Eyes torn from their sockets
Talons piercing the flesh
Epidermal layers torn from my chest
Fear logged in your larynx
Screams of torment trapped inside
As you are left, left to die

Bodies lie on the ground
Victims of his killing spree

Left here to die, to signify his wrath of abolishment
Corpses that lie, intensify the way that you die
Rotting flesh prevails, blood begins to hail from the sky above
Masses of remains left here to lay before his altar

Your entire life, your religion is embedded in your mind
Words spoken from a book, tell you never to change
After death you are taught, your soul will cleansed
But even reduced to ashes, the misery still prevails

The day has finally come for you to be put to rest
As your body enters the furnace

Searing fire begins its bath
As your entity begins its path

There will be no rebirth of your soul
Emptiness that clouds your depression
Forced in to see the light, knowing Jesus wept

Only one thing clinging to your mind
The prayers to the feeble god whom you once believed in

Looking at the mortals from your cauldron of pain
Weeping as you know nothing will make this end
But now an even greater pain engulfs you
Reincremation did you no good, return to inflict others

Your credulous family somehow hears your pitiful cries
They take the urn which contains what is left of your mortal life
It's taken back to the crematory to attempt once again
The brutal burning of your soul, thought to cleanse

The beginning of sorrow has come.
You cannot build but can destroy with what is left on earth.
Damage, now permanent, is yet enhanced day by day by unstoppable greed.
You are never truly happy unless one suffers more than yourself.
The choice is none, you will live in a world where you must fight a battle.
Some weaker, some stronger, in termination we'll die as one.
We fight amongst ourselves, enhanced by racial difference.
Our hatred never to diminish, it's just growing and growing 'till
out day of release.

We race towards the years of tribulation, where wars, plagues and
the antichrist.

What is the antichrist?
What is it's form?
Questions still asked yet unanswered.
No need for answers, with it's arrival brings sorrow, a sorrow soon
dealt upon all.

Perhaps it's a pestilence in a form of virus spreading in it's own
epidemic.
Perhaps it is famine killing off millions.
Does this happen 'cause we lack enough food.

One man's greed affects others less privileged, a cruel form of
population control.

Why does this happen?
It is predestined fate not open for reason or change.
It's all been predicted, we'll die in vast numbers of a sickness
that has no known cure.

We'll play the unknowing yet all are aware tribulation is here now
for sure.

Eulogy inscribed in the scrolls of humanity.
Ancient scriptures of predicted demise.
A world encased in the womb of it's ignorance.
Extinction will be swift, relentless butchery.

The structure collapses, spewing forth mutation.
Plague bathes the earth from infected skies.
Chaotic saturation into the pores of existence.
Breeding the spawn.
Effigy awake in it's mummified region.
Silent tombs concealed from the light.
Gruelling afterlife christened by their deaths.
Malignant offspring of decrepit birth.

Impurity of souls.

Visions of the agony tightly close the weeping sky.
Spirits of what will be invert the earth unfertile.
Anxiously await reprisal for the deprived life.
Horrifying rituals of unorthodox intelligence.

Premature suffering from within their charred domain.
Altering the promises of peaceful rest and afterlife.
Hideous denial of a once forgotten life.

Ascending messiah.
Conqueror of the apocalypse.

Divine majesty.
Giver of supreme entity.

Churches rise from disturbed grounds.
Symphony of depression purifies.
All will be altered.
The dead choir will sing.
Hymns of blasphemous irreverence.

The servant of the higher power is summoned by the emptiness of the
lost souls. With wings extended, it sweeps across the land looking
for it's helpless victims. 

The young and old are it's prey; the ones
not strong enough to survive. 

Penetrate the minds
Of those misfortuned at birth
Murder is etched
In the deepest chasms of the soul
Salvation stripped
From the origin of existence
Obstinacy abandons
As you yield your world to me

Decree of my darkest dreams
Memories of my future
Welcome to my church

Sodomize my cross
For it now marks your existence
Dismissal of lucidity
Consume my body and blood
Supplicate for death
Obscurity condemns the structure
Spectral abominations
The gathering of souls

Befall the rise of inhumanity

Returned to a land you've never been
You kill again for the first time
Recollections of what never was

Decree of my darkest dreams
Memories of my future
Welcome to my church

I am your savior
Shapeless to your perception
For I am you, pierced from within

Pierced from within

The thought of killing entered my mind some time ago
What possesses an individual to kill
I have often
Pondered the thought
Time and time again
Now it's clear to me

They want me to be part of this world they have created
I say fuck you, don't tell me how to live

Maybe if I eliminate the people
Who fit this so-called mold
My pain will finally be released
And my mind free of thought

The axe struck hard and fast
Splitting the skull in two
She fell instantly
The blood spewed
From where her head used to be
I then struck another blow

Only the lives of others
Can quench my harsh reality

I received much excitement
From these two blows
I must continue to strike her corpse
Once again I brought the tool of my trade

I proceeded to hack several more times
A pile of flesh now lies before me

Unrelenting need to fulfill my lust for death
I must purge the world of its filth

Disorder scars my mind
With killing fascination
My tasks are far from done
Everything must die

Why do you torment me?
You make me hate my existence
You will soon surpass
Your own fucking life
Now the time has come
For you to see your death
I cut your flesh
I receive much pleasure

As you start to bleed
I no longer control my urges
The feeling is so complete
I'm finally at one with myself

Now that I control the rest of your existence
How does it feel to be in pain and misery?
For many years you made me feel that way
I praised you for so long
I'm now your god

I cannot control my urges
Now I must take my revenge
I slice at you
You begin to die

The pleasure was all yours
To have the strength to leave and not look back
To give up completely
No more will to survive

Now that all is done
My completed masterpiece
This sinful life of mine
Will not go to waste
The pleasure's all mine

To have taken your mortal life
I am what you created
To inflict my own pain and misery

You manipulated my mind
Filled it with your lies
Feasted on my soul
Destroyed my will
Now there's nothing
No reason for reason
Now I must take my life
To repent my sins

Reality suspends my present life
Curious thoughts, I confront my mortality
Uncertain to the laws of the unknown
I have no fear in facing trials of the mind
One by one
Sifting through ossuaries of creation
Looking for a worth, is existence pointless?
Perceptive to the truth, I never may return
Resistance falling short, I sever all my ties
One by one

Vanish into the unseen origins of infinity
A pleasant swim in the seas of dormant ecstasy
A state of being I could spend with all of eternity
Suspended above the remains of what I used to be

I can see things not capable of imagining
The explanation of my mind has progressed me endlessly
Things that once were illusions have become reality
I perceive now what was never clear to me

Unwelcomed kind
No way to overcome, I'm disadvantaged prey
My way back has been erased

Torn from my bliss
No longer bound in flesh, a disembodied soul
Helpless to what I can't see

Unwelcomed kind
No way to overcome, a disembodied soul
My way back has been erased.

I must focus on what I can't see
Things done to me, I cannot explain
Falling further from myself
To give in would end all my pain
Subconscious misery placed unto me

Is there meaning to this life?
To break away transparent light
The end is clearer
Pass through the mirror
I fade into the sky

Hanging in the balance
Drowning in the afterlife

Brain patterns altered since birth
To serve the higher cause
Pawns of twisted vision
Manipulate to do thy bidding

It is easy for them
To control us this way
To think is obsolete
Therefore no way to question their rule

A mindless, lifeless zombie
To walk the rest of its days
There's only one law to serve them
All else results in termination
Breeding is done by means of test tubes

It seems strange to me
To end up this way
Torn from my state of being
Stripped of all my worth

I can no longer feel
What is now being done to me

I have awakened
Yet cannot move
Paralysis has stricken me

I pray for death
I cannot speak
Enslavement now possesses me

Bleed, bleed
You scream at me
Draining
Worthless is my soul you say
You feed the lie
To collapse my will
Feed, feed
On what's left of me
Eating away at a life I once lived

You left me in your wake
Or so you think
Vigilant in your plans to deny
You will not overtake
To win the stakes
I will not cower to your lies
Your foolish greedy mind
Is filled with selfish pride
It will bring you to your knees
Flailing in the cess
This convoluted mess
The origin of your disease

Brain patterns altered since birth
To serve the higher cause
Pawns of twisted vision
Manipulate to do thy bidding

The world in which we live has been plagued
By the essence of the beast
Murdering has become a daily ritual
The able-bodied minds of the world
Try to solve the problems
With their pathetic solutions
As long as the underworld has the upper hand
Nothing will be solved

I believe that which has been done to you
Should be done to others
Kill the man who invades your world
Violent acts of nature
Have uplifted the roots of the Earth

Disasters which have not been
Seen for decades
Have surfaced to a place which once
Was free of woe
It's now filled with death and killing
There is no cure

We will soon be punished
For what we have done
I await the moment
I am prepared

There will come a time in life
To take control
To protect thyself and my own
I will kill if need be

Society feeds on each other as prey
I will not become a victim
Rather a predator if needed
Human life means little, little to me

If you lash at me
You have chosen your fate
Life as you know
Will cease to exist

Chemicals revive my life
Reanimated, brought back again
My diametrical state
Has assured me eternal life

Serum no longer fluid
Respiratorial terminus
Artificial resurrection
Dosage inefficiency

Potency too weak to perfect
Cartilage reaching gelency
Misconception of technology

Unknown duration to live
Decadence, your state of being
Purification progresses
Subside

Bones that collapse in time will heal
Brain patterns submerged in unconsciousness
Only to be awakened by the peroneal senses
To see once again, to be reborn

Needles perforate my neck
Cyanide smothers my existence
My torso lies raped of essence
Impotent state
I cease to exist
As my former self
Synthetically revived

Shapeless beings of unknown origin
Scanning the cosmic blackened abyss
Planting the seed of their horror and hatred

Mankind was created to be violent and sick
Feasting on the screams of the pain we inflict
Led down the path of our own extermination

They plant a device to watch us all
To see the way we will evolve

Tampering with the subconscious
They hold our fate
Twisting the minds of the people
With whom they create
Breeding our lives with insanity
To purge my spirit's enslavery
They're feeding off of our hatred
They will then devour

Withdraw our life's blood from within us
To reproduce their own kind

Infant of theirs to vanquish life
The brood of hatred now swells within

Screaming
Your lives begin to decimate
Pleading
Provoking horror, dealing our fate

Put here only to replenish the substance
In which they need
And now you see all hope is lost and gone
To reveal reincarnation

Eulogy inscribed in the scrolls of humanity
Ancient scriptures of predicted demise
A world encased in the womb of its ignorance
Extinction will be swift, relentless butchery

The structure collapses, spewing forth mutation
Plague bathes the Earth from infected skies
Chaotic saturation into the pores of existence
Breeding the spawn

Effigy awake in its mummified region
Silent tombs concealed from the light
Gruelling afterlife christened by their deaths
Malignant offspring of decrepit birth

Impurity of souls

Visions of the agony tightly close the weeping sky
Spirits of what will be invert the Earth unfertile
Anxiously await reprisal for the deprived life
Horrifying rituals of unorthodox intelligence

Premature suffering from within their charred domain
Altering the promises of peaceful rest and afterlife
Hideous denial of a once forgotten life

Ascending messiah
Conqueror of the apocalypse

Divine majesty
Giver of supreme entity

Churches rise from disturbed grounds
Symphony of depression purifies
All will be altered
The dead choir will sing
Hymns of blasphemous irreverence
Sermons of impiety complement the mass

For many years I put my trust in you
Perceiving the vows I took that were true
Only to learn all had been lost to you

To search for meanings not truly there
Answers to questions only bring despair
Distractions down the path of our lives

Unforgiving

Was there a point to nine years we had
Selfish thoughts leave you undesirable
Part of me was severed that very day

In the wake of confusion I search, looking
For the answers to questions only reveal

Sorrow fills my weeping eyes
Plague and famine revived
Reaping the benefits of life's tomb
Insolent your fate
To weep once more
To seal our fate, look at what we've done
to this holy place

Fought through the centuries of time
Religious undertones befall the earth
A god of everlasting peace
Yet lives are lost to you
Is there such a place as this
Supposed equality amongst all beings
To serve the almighty one

Plague... another tool of demise
Thin the weak and feeble to die
Father, why have you forsaken me
The child that sits upon your cross
Molest the innocence to quench the thirst

Representing the church an unholy curse
Brought before judgement the eyes of hypocrisy
An unfitting place this must be

Sorrow fills my weeping eyes
Plague and famine revived
Reaping the benefits of life's tomb
Insolent your fate
To weep once more
To seal our fate, look at what we've done
to this holy place

Contrived a plan for all to die
Mislead to believe your lies
Does this not seem too harsh
Slaughtering the lambs that are lost

Famine... another tool of demise
Starving the innocent left to die
Father, why have you forsaken me

Souls, souls to deny
Oppressed to a promised place

To desire a place for you to die, unbeknownst to you thoroughly denied.
Expectations of a fruitful way to live, ungodly not to be achieved by you.
Evil lies, death denied
cursed to walk this pitiful existence
To be taught a certain way to be,
let down by the powers consuming me

Souls, souls to deny
Oppressed to the promised place

God has abandoned you pain and misery a gift to you.
How do I deserve all this despite this unholy place
Infliction of desires purging thoughts realized

Souls, souls to deny
Oppressed to a promised

To dissect the mind impaled of visions a delusional
state from which one neglects
Incise the flesh with delicate precision
as to not disrupt such artistry

To dominate a field of iniquity undeserving of many.
One must realize a painful demise deeds of tranquillity.
Inflicting misery, an instrument of morbidity thrust deep on you.
Conflicted desires will transpire justify what's right.
Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venomous to you
Surgery of impalement

The blood drips from my hands
Your flesh is warm upon my face
Impaled with a collection of sickness
To desire that what you receive

Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venomous to you
Surgery of impalement

Damn the forgotten seeds
Inbred as a slave to habitual needs
Souls consumed.
Denied a response from a lifeless tomb

Precious births
Destruct to a plague that infects the earth
Now regret the spawn unnurtured
And feared to be dead by dawn

Curse the consumed, born a salve
Reformed a distorted spawn of a masochist
Deformities cripple and mold
So you breathe but don't exist
Internally decompose,
Skin erodes and exposes the skeletons
Damn the genes incestuously cloned
To prey upon the innocent.

Impotent, world demise
Incarnate sacrifice
Feeble breed disposed in a world disowned
Demise of the Clone

Genocidal fate I impose, will reign upon you
Those who mourn fear for their own,
Mentally enslaved and subdued
Landlords of the killing fields,
Reuse plots of the decomposed
Tombstones don't identify,
A graveyard of the dormant souls

Mass catacombs, putrefied lie beneath
The uncivilized, disturbed and the weak
Under tyrant

Impure thoughts provoke my mind,
Undeniable deeds I implore
Sickness helps fill the void, I feel I must react

Is it me am I alone
Is it me am I alone

Why do I think this way have I been pushed to far
Nothing makes sense to me really what does it all mean

Is it me am I alone
Is it me am I alone

I feel I must release frustrations on the weak
Inconceivable accommodations
Creep in my deviant thoughts
Visions of devoured flesh
Sift through the awakened mind
How would it feel to rip you in half

To relinquish the mind may invoke a path
Destined to bring oneself closer to the truth
To deny these thoughts may rid you of insanity
To taste the flesh that consumes you

Subconsciously Enslaved

Death is
So close
Can You
Feel it

Is it me am I alone
Is it me am I alone

Is it me am I alone
Is it me am I alone

I feel the pain
Flooding the gates
Open the mind
Release the insane
Snapping the chains
To pick the lock
Awaken thyself and release the hate

To walk amongst the dead
Plagued by an undeniable thirst for blood.
Stained by an immortal suffering given to you.

Acceptance from your kind
Is only a temporal solution to your misery.
Transcending time haunts your very existence visions
Of events are forever imbedded in your mind.

For you are never allowed to sleep eternally.
Countless prey have satisfied your hunger.
Intoxicated with the essence of life
Blood tastes so sweet

The lives of many course through your veins.
To live off the lives of others seems morbid.
But to you they are only a source of food
Blood splatters as you bite deep and hard
Draining every once of liquid.

A lifeless corpse falls to the ground.
As you stand before the waste you create.
A path walked time and time again.

Has darkened the emotionless heart.
To deny the pleasures of feelings

To feel one would certainly starve to death.
But how ironic since death does not become you.
As you sit amongst the bones of judgement
Contemplating your role.

You are never ending drawn out
To oversee the mistrials
And demise of others
A prisoner of your own prison

Immortally condemned to you
Why does this have to be?

Immortally condemned to you
Why does this have to be?

Etched within the centuries,
Bequeathed upon the generations
Litanies guide the baneful,
Serve the scourge of enmity
Inheritance taught nothing less
Than absolute superiority
Resurrecting what time has seen, pontificating savagery

Echoes of ignorance
Scrolls of hatred and prejudicial idolatry
Words of malice scald the culture while raping society

Spoken tales defile all purity
History enshrines the absurd
Forced to relive the insanity relive
Revert the passages of time, unearth archaic ways
Reset epoch's once dispersed, enslave rationality
Exhibit the bleeding of man's ancient wounds
Share this misguided pain,
Conjure the demons of the past

Defy, fall to no demigod
Blasphemous their theologies
Inquisitions punish sinners, justify the genocide
Cleanse the bastards, slay the torrid,
Rid the land of stained skin
Words of insolence ordain the future
Plague the seed of morality
Behold... the tomes of acrimony

Coercion steers domination, campaign segregation
One feasts the victors fruits,
Serfs gorge the ample dirt
Last gasps, stifled by the blood
Of intolerance's wrath

Defy, beseech no demigod
Subordinate, all distant creeds
One creator to punish sinners, capitulate genocide
Denounce the bastards, slay the torrid,
Slay all sons of stained skin
Words of ignorance defend no logic
Fuel the flames of idiocy
Behold... the tomes of acrimony

An open book a will of life
A Gathering of sorts, strings pull the chord
Contusions unfold beneath the dermal layers
Silence uplifts the structure
Nailed and fixed, An ornament to the cause
A slave to his will, Reconstructed to uphold
I will be reborn, Lives ripped and torn
An abomination reborn
Inconceivable power unleashed, Pure evil set forth
To crush the skulls of many and bend the will of the unknowing
Sins of his will, Strings pull the chord
Forced upon you, Absorbs into me sins reborn
Strings of his will, Strings pull the chord
Forced upon you, Absorbs into me sins reborn
Bow down before me, Heed my call
Restitution of all sins
Bow down before me, Heed my call
Be delivered through me

A forgotten absolution remains within the shadows
Reborn and replenished to reflect sights unseen
The sins of the fallen will be exceeded by the sins of all
To cross through the kingdom of fire and blood
Possession of fate and destiny misplaced
Betrayal and abandonment embraced
Disingenuous fate for all to suffer
Force feed this hate to rise and to fall
The protection of all placed into the wrong hands
Mass deception passed down repeatedly

False impressions of truths instilled
Force of negativity, Doorway scrolls
Oath, beg, Absence, Redemption
Paranoid, abandonment, Betrayal, murder, genocide

Redemption, Rise above the pain and horror
To survive this reign of hell on earth
Remit absolution climb out of the shadows
Countless more souls will pass through

For those who rise and those who fall
Disingenuous life passed down to all
Grant you the pardon of all your sins
For those who rise and those who fall

Possession of fate and destiny misplaced
Betrayal and abandonment embraced

Force of negativity, Doorways, scrolls
Oath, beg, Absence, Redemption
Paranoid, abandonment, Betrayal, murder, genocide

Redemption

Torture provokes to divorce sanity
Horror mummifies victims who plead
Suicide tempts the mind of the mortal, sickened with grief
Godless fate, perception of the lie, debilitate the weak

Upon the altar of sacrificial bliss
I'm damned to be disposed in perpetual fire
Dismantled youth, forced and shaped my being
Predestined fate nurtures the act of sinning and drives me to

Blind torture kill, You judge my world
Your views have been mistaken
The sickness stems deeper than it seems

I bind to keep, Torture one to strengthen
And killed the weak who fail to meet the needs
Unstable diagnosis, detained to live a victim of myself
Predestined fate nurtures the act of sinning and drives me to

Bind torture kill, Crippled soul, Desensitized
Restraints impeded, Evolving my rage
Bind torture kill, Sanity diminishing
Internal wars desecrate, Re-haunting me
Lunacy dictates my being

Enslaved until my demise surrenders me
Until then I must feed the demons
Fuel my rage and commence haunting you

Bind torture kill, Disposed mental state
Confides my will to tolerate, My plea to help denied
You judge my world, Your views have been mistaken

This sickness stems deeper than it seems
I bind to keep, torture one to strengthen
And killed the weak who fail to meet the needs

I'm damned to be disposed in perpetual fire
Dismantled youth forced and shaped my being
Deafening voices fuel my actions
And drive me to bind torture kill

Everything you thought or were led to believe was a misconception
This unsafe approach at life has killed all hope within.
Worthless attempts of achieving happiness
Disgusted, mistrusted, betrayed and persuaded
Revelling such feelings, mistakes of disgrace
The shock and disbelief of reality SETS IN
The weight of the world CRUSHES
These pains within are intolerable
Changes are of utmost importance

Intolerable ways of living brought on by oneself
Waiting to be let down,
Depression, remove for all negative surroundings
False perceptions broken dreams
Living this unhappy life is not worth living

Whose life to take? Mine or theirs
Dismiss the anguish brought one self
Relearn how to live and only trust yourself
Disgusted, mistrusted, betrayed and persuaded
revelling such feelings, mistakes of disgrace
Obsession, Betrayal, Murder, Suicide
Negative energy trapped and enraged
Unable to fix what has/is,
Essence of death kills all in its path.

Why am I here?
What did you say? Stop talking to me
Once I was told therefore I am not
My father once told me to shut up, shut up

Is this where I came from?
Do I know you? Is this real or not?
Where do I belong?
As I was correcting my head I feel ill

Hurts to comprehend
My translucent patterns of delirium
Shut up, shut up you

The pieces no longer fit the puzzle
My glue will no longer hold me
Is this all in my head? Or is that you talking to me?
Who goes there? and why have you come?

Leave me be, lock the door behind you
Let go of my head
I seem to have misplaced myself
Can you help me find my way?

Plead for your soul, my world is law
Uprise the tyrannous
Wars disguise and justify damnable needs
Re-haunting souls in graveyards of atrocities

Crippled in my mind... desecrate and alter the state of my faith
Conscience that's over-ruled, destroy and tarnish the will of one
Masses who mourn, curse, and despise and martyr beloved ones
Land that once bred our existence now holds the cold of crypts

Perpetrators of this dreadful evil still exist
Crippling fear alters the focus of life that is
Youth denied, exist in a state of war
Adapt or die as kids

Law of the infidel, kill or be killed
Goal of the infidel, destroy and rebuild
Reward of the chosen few, power we've gained
Fate shared by all, Pain, Pain, Pain

War scars traumatize and burn truth in flesh
Blood stains paint that led lives to death
land that once bred our existence now holds the cold crypts

Perpetrators of this dreadful evil still exist
Crippling fear alters the focus of life that is trained to destroy your fate
And will, Kill or be killed

Law of the infidel, kill or be killed
Goal of the infidel destroy and rebuild
Reward of the chosen few, power we've gained
Fate shared by all, pain, pain, pain

Visions of murder take place in my mind
I strip the souls from the worthless
Euphoric pleasure saturates, but this is real
These memories of conflict and struggle

Why do I feel these feelings of regret and pity?
But what has happened? There's blood on my hands
What have I done? I do not know
Recollections becoming clear, Flesh under my nails is really here

The monster that I've become
Has just done what cannot be undone
Unconscious state, who am I?
What have I done? I do not know

Massive confusion, massive confusion overwhelms and saturates, saturates my conscious
A million misconceptions feel all too real
I'm an entanglement of disillusion, blessed by virtues of strife

What of my normal life? The acts I remember
What if they don't exist? I they're not real?
Betrayal of oneself - existing - unknowing
The misuse of life has led me to this state of dementia

The evil that courses through my veins consumes me whole
I strip the soul from your worthlessness
You turn cold as I take from you last kiss

The many pleasures of the flesh consummate my self indulgences
A being so beautiful as you tingles the senses and pushes one to defilement
Like the lamb to the slaughter what terrible things I would do to you,

You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you
Submerge myself in your blood and wear your flesh, you are so fucking beautiful
You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you

Entangled in a pile of flesh and blood warm yet cold at the same time
Now is the time to reflect on what could have been
Visions of delirium and blurs of misleading laughter cry out
At one moment the words that were once spoken muffled by the distance of passing soon become clear

You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you
Submerge myself in your blood and wear your flesh, you are so fucking beautiful
You are so beautiful; I bathe myself in the entrails of you

With the last whispers of breath left upon your lips
You still reach to call out as if to say something that once was meant
But it distorts my ears as it has no meaning anymore

What was that you were saying? I can't hear you
Speak up, what? Still not understanding
Sorry, Goodbye, goodbye

The end of ends, to solve the problem
The cause of death, the sum of our stricken lies
Natural selection, a dying dog will die

The old stray of the pack we weep in pity
To see the utter truth, believe in infamy
Destroy and conquer and lacerate humanity

Beneath the bowels of a hollow life they dwell
Without belief, isolations now reality
The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed

The end of ends our path is sanctified
Strangulation to rid ourselves of heresy
Altercations a cruel hand we strike
No remorse, plague and famine nullify
Thrones of blood and pain reside amongst the dead

Kill your own blood-shed, external dissident
Abolish life, no thought of human retrospect

Denounce their kin with strife, inside they hope we die
Breeding spawns you know will come sacrificed
Blind feeding shallow minds as souls are left denied

I strike the weak, Bloodshed resides over me
I strike the weak, Pawns left denied

An end to ends drains the souls who plead
Infected within the timeless slumber of those who heed
An end to ends drains the souls who plead
Infected within the timeless slumber of those who heed

The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed
The end of ends our path is sanctified
Strangulation to rid ourselves of heresy

The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed
The end of ends is now indicative
Suffocation to rid ourselves of heresy

I strike the weak
Bloodshed resides over me
I strike the weak
Pawns left denied

Pressure on the inner walls of my brain grows heavier. I must
Alleviate the pain I feel, for soon many will die as they come
Before me with effortless attempts. The search for divine power
Beckons me and the only way to achieve is to destroy. Victims of a
Torn society lay in waste, as I pick through the bloody carcasses.
Dead bodies just seem to fall before me.

Saving the most edible morsels, the weak ones scatter. With bloody
Weapon in hand, I tear through the limbs. Cries of anguish filter
Through the land, echoing in the valley. Many have tried to come
Before me with effortless attempts. I sift my way through the fields
Of dead bodies, stopping to take a trophy or two.

The fields run deep and far, for I have killed many and I must
Travel far to reach my destination.

My final resting place, where I will be reborn. For now, the air is
Still, smell of dead bodies is ever so prevalent. I am the last and
Here I shall remain. The pain I have once felt is lifted from my
Being. Villages of useless waste, a race witch does not deserve to
Live. I reek havoc amongst the children from a present with no
Future,

For I am the strong and those who defy me lay in waste. The days of
Travel are long and the stench of how many I have killed lingers on.

I am tired and need rest, but the forces pulls me to my
Destination

From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Withdrawn from my veins I spill
An Existence defined
By the paths I saturate

Laws you impose
Get overruled
Irrelevant ways of the fools
sentenced before, higher courts
I'm self detained,
In ways you judge not

Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Bleed the fuckin truth
Or die by the fraud
That's become of you
Denounce clones and amongst
Kings, who use the flame
and BURN

Blood in, blood out
Blood in, blood out

Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

Bleed for the oath taken
Bleed for the oath taken


Detours denied,
Tell tales, of masses who failed
Unearth and incinerate the old
Feeble ways

From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Violently ripped
From the arms of my bliss
An end to what is,
Life's dismissed
My screams, my pain,
I am no longer sane
How can this be
The end of my reign?

What have I done
To deserve all of this?
In the blink of an eye
All things have changed
And how will I make it through all this?
This nightmare that I cannot wake from

My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize
I cannot leave

Embracing this plane of insane
Mental state
Of strange Confusion -
Consumes me whole
And somehow
I'm trapped here
Within perceiving no escape
Wretched horror warps my fate

My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize I cannot leave

Dismal dream
Impressions of fear
Deception of self,
Am I stuck here?
Made to see,
Soul stripped from within me
No chance of escape
My dismal dream
I live and breathe
I realize
I cannot leave
I cannot leave

Sanity collapses
In the blink of an eye
Irrational behavior
Manifests from inside

Violently ripped
From the arms of my bliss
An end to what is
Life's dismissed
My screams, my pain
I am no longer sane
How can this be
The end of my reign?

To pray for forgiveness
What have I done?
No one seems to care
Ask for guidance
But it falls on deaf ears
If there is one who will hear me
How does he not answer
Look to the sky
Sins rain down from above
Once again I ask of thee to forgive me
A mishandling of a situation

Leaves me at your mercy
I only ask to look
At my life as a whole
Why do you not answer

Can it be there is no one to answer
After all we have been taught

Solo: Hobbs

Mislead teachings
Lead to no conclusions
A false hope
That all would be forgiven
Allows one to do as he pleases.

So I ask of thee again to forgive me
Forgive me no answer to my plea

What I can't hear you have left me to not

Darkness falls covering the day
Ghoulish figures
Move between the shadows
Unexplained voices come from nowhere
Caught between here and there
Left over fragments repeat
A life once lost played over and over

Disturbing images unfold
Tortured figures
Recreate a deed
Evil is the host this night
Demonic sounds
Consume the darkness

Darkness falls covering the day
Ghoulish figures
Move between the shadows
Unexplained voices

As they prey upon the living
Concede made flesh delivers to be
Transpondent unremorseful please
Relinquish thy soul and transcend forth

Between here and now
Deliver upon darkness
Befall the pits of despair
And rise from the shadows
To reclaim an heir
Sit upon my side to rule

A calamitous future
Warning cries of inhuman terror
As time elapses
A period of purification draws near.
Those who survive
Will endure endless
Dark periods of spaces and time

Visionary - profound

The wounds of all
Have become one

Rise to power
Ominous games of slaughter
A future yet to unfold
Fire and swords
Shall sweep the land
The end of time
This unnumbered
The terrible judge
Will judge his people.
Indigenous events plague

Indigenous events plague
First light of wisdom
The 4th world will end
And the 5th will begin
Cataclysmic changes
Will soon be upon us.

Disillusion
The world will be set on fire
The great day of purification
Upheaval
Period of worthy change.

Indigenous events plague
Indigenous events plague
Indigenous events plague
Indigenous events plague

Disconnected from virtuous opinions
A shift of reality
Transposed and redefined
Remedial decisions become complex.
Voices come from all angles
Sifting through
Disorder to achieve stability.
So many ways to choose.
Vile atrocities fill one corner.

Righteousness and honesty
Cling to a small fragment.
Greed and power
Jump a round at a frantic pace.

Admission off inner conflict
Drops one to his knees
Make them stop, make them stop,
Stop whispering to me.

It doesn't want to hurt anymore
One can't decipher right or wrong
Disablement of neural senses
Relish in the thought
Of self preservation.

Scars inside his head,
He now only sees in red
MENTAL HEMMORAGE
Truth erodes over time,
Expiring what's left of his mind

Rip the flesh tear the limb
Blood pours from within
Rip the flesh Tear the limb
Blood pours from within

Visions of tranquillity
Shrouded by violence.
Peace and serenity clouds over.

Now broken and exposed
By inept judgment
The end draws close
He knows what he must do
Thoughts within
Guide him down the path
Know one will
Survive the aftermath.

Enemies from the Womb
Hypocrites will consume
Tales they claim

Sodomized by your priest
Consoled through punished
Slaves before your lord
Effigies

Disdained, views you preach
Threaten mankind
Restrain the God fearing
Sickening masses
Zombified existence
Run from fear
Through prayer.

Demise creeps in and fills the skies

Zombified progression towards a cliff

A lifetime of misdeeds,
Has lead you to me.
You've made your last mistake.
This time you won't get away.

I'll see to it
That these are your last breaths,
And strip the life with my bare hands,
You never saw me coming,
Now I’ve got you.
It's gone on to long, this time it ends.

And now I'm to take your life,
And still this will not rectify
What you have done.
What have you done?
To torture the soul, undeserving
Seems to be the only way,
To resolve your unjust ways

Your misdeeds,
Have lead you to me.
You've made your last mistake.
This time you won't get away.

You never saw me coming,
Now I’ve got you
Now that I have you,
I'll do as I please staring into me
While these hands
Grip around your throat
Your life flashing before you,
How could this have happened?
I clench, tighter and tighter,
Staring into your blood filled eyes.
I know what you want to say,
But I care not to hear

You cannot undo what you've done,
This is forever. There's no going back,
You did this to yourself,
Through a life mis-lived
And no one can save you now

Holding on,
Tightly gripped
Realize that this is my last resort
Latched on to what is worthless
It ends here and now

What can you possibly be thinking?
As these eyes stare into yours...
Is this happening to me?
Here and now?
Undeserving

Scarred Souls, Remain raw

I sit as tomorrow I die and today I will unburden my soul
These events have tortured me, and destroyed me
I can still hear her faint screams engulfed in the atmosphere around me
The stench of ammonia still encircles the room where her disemboweled corpse lies
One night returning home, much intoxicated, I fancied my wife to avoid me

I seized her with, with the fury of a demon instantaneously possessed
I knew myself no longer
My original soul, at once to leave my body and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every
fiber of my frame
At an instant, I grabbed the knife from the kitchen
and left incision from ear to ear
In turn, her limp weak corpse fell instantaneously

I, in return having received much pleasure from the
initial blow
had begun to cut into her abdomen
Once inside, I began exploring the regions of her innards
The warm blood still running, the warm blood still running down my hands is cold and damp.

I began to remove her intestines, stopping to take a little nibble or two
Her uterus seems to mesmerize me as I bury my head into it
And lose myself into a world of the subconscious
For now I know the many pleasures of my wife
And I will soon be joining her

To pray for forgiveness
What have I done?
No one seems to care
Ask for guidance
But it falls on deaf ears
If there is one who will hear me
How does he not answer
Look to the sky
Sins rain down from above
Once again I ask of thee to forgive me
A mishandling of a situation

Leaves me at your mercy

So I ask of thee again to forgive me
Forgive me no answer to my plea

What I can't hear you have left me to not

Channelling forces we don't understand
Into energy currents eternal
Whisper the passage once spoken
To enter the void before it collapses
Silence the patterns that echo
Yet still the voices can be heard
In this place beyond time
Astral projection
The dimensional loop
Natural law of infinite power

The many will become the few
Eternal torment perceived as paradise
Reflection of time
This is where you die

You have no future
Channelling dimensional energy
Forbidden transgression
Consequence - the violation

You have no future
Channelling dimensional energy

Astral projection
Natural law of infinite power

The answer to all questions
Was once whispered
It echoes perpetually
Throughout the halls of time
Forcing man to perceive destiny
The essential frequency of life's essence
Was once pure and untainted
But man will and must drift
Into the numb and dissident

Guiding lost souls from the womb to the grave
Converting all who were free to a slave

The true message distorted
As intertwined and lost
Causing man to seek the source
The profound essence of conquest
Aimlessly wandering, seeking the unknown
Drifting too far to feel the reverberations

Inverting the message
The secret was intertwined...

..and lost within itself, and reversed life's passage

Alter - life's frequencies
Only somehow we feel the truth
It distorts - and inverts

Intertwine
Life's frequencies
Life's passage
Reversal of the message
To alter perception

As time passes and life's frequency is altered
As time passes and life's frequency is altered

Dampness becomes this night
Half moon illuminates the scene
A gathering of unsuspecting souls
Are about to embark on a journey

From which they will not return
Telling tales an ominous figure
Is seen in the distance
Curious souls will
Always have a need to investigate

Some things should be left alone

This creature is not of this dimension
It lusts for the blood of man's flesh
And this eve the blood shall rain

In an instant claws of immense size
Rip limbs from their hosts
Razor sharp claws take chunks of meat
One soul in a desperate attempt to save the others
Offers himself a sacrificial lamb
The creature will have none of this
It is here for one thing and that is the blood of
Others

Spines snapped, heads cracked, carnage ensues
The ones who shall find this scene of malevolence
Shall be forever scarred

Transcend the continuous
The unspeakable
Continuum of suffering
There is no end, the future eternal
What should be over, is dragged out for eternity
Confined to a loop which has no end

Our flesh, the physical, will dissolve
And the essence is all that remains
Drifting, latching on to anything that's obtainable
Caught between two worlds
Where one without the other can not exist
Transcending beyond the atmospheric realm

From the first breath of deception
To the last gasp of hope
Drawing deceit into lungs

You look over your shoulder
Hoping not to see
What you think it is you saw
But it is, it always is

Always by yourself, but never alone
You see things, that no one else sees
Hearing the whisper, speaking the ancient words
Unbound power bestowed

Excruciating visions
But are they visions?
Or are they real
Manifestations of death

Seeing atrocious things
Feeling horrible pains
Living out the end of eternity

Having travelled the darkest path
Disregarding the life I was given
Intentional plunder, the degradation
My self hatred becomes isolated
I've succumbed to the darkness
Feel the warmth devour my soul
Inescapable fate
Approaching transcendence
I see clarity through deprivation

My actions beg and plead
For an end to this insane world
Mortal death encroaches
Ending life that had no meaning
But the fractal portal opens
Slipping through dimensions
Dreadful path once binding
Now leading to enlightenment

Visions of immaculate detail
In vibrant clarity
I've been given the answers
And seen unimaginable sights
I have touched and altered
The physical and the spiritual
Realms of deception embedding the lies
Plaguing the future of all mankind

So bleak...so dismal
Parallels have become entangled
Scriptures deciphered revealing the truth

Only through death can you transcend the lies

Inherit the knowledge that was manipulated
Now awakens the soul through consciousness
This is not suicide it's devotion
Sever the flesh, ascend and receive
Clarity through deprivation (x 4)
Deprivation

Embrace the darkest of your fears
And seek the warmth within the dark
The fear and pain you live with
Will keep you from transcending

Everything you were taught
To believe in this life, was a lie
It's all to keep you from knowing
The terrifying truth is that
This life is only the passage to death
Perception of life - holographic deception
Illusions unknown to all mankind

Reborn to live out these insufferable lives
Damned to the cycle of enslavement
The only way to pass through
Is to take your own life
And receive the gifts from the gods

You choke
Cannot swallow
The truth has made you vomit
You now know
Your vessel is hollow
And you're left to weep and wallow
Gagged by the truth
Gasping for air that's not there
Frantically reaching for hope within
Deception, your perception
Is the center of all reflection

You choke

Gagged by the truth
Gasping for air that's not there
Frantically reaching for hope within
Deception, your perception

To go beyond what's real
To question your existence
This is how you'll find
The answers you seek

Your fear is where it thrives
It breeds within its lies
It feeds on lives in pain
Consuming souls forever binding the weak

The only way to be truly free
And break the chain of slavery
Is to embrace and go beyond
Beyond the warmth within the dark
Is what we were taught to fear and shun
The thought that there's a chance
To understand the cycle can be broken
But you must take your life

From the time you understood anything
You're misled to believe a false truth
If you lived on in one's glory
All that could befoul would be diverted

This couldn't be further from the truth
You control nothing
And there's nothing you can do
Your path has been set
And to this you will see it through

Dividing the flesh and the essence
While dying - you see as you should
But could never see
Fleeing the host - panic frenzy
Your last breaths to be counted
And faint images fade as hope loses its worth

Lift the veil to see the unseen
The absence of light, exquisite agony
Forked tongue messenger
Deliverer whose words are the key
The door of perception unlocks

This couldn't be further from the truth
You control nothing
And there's nothing you can do
Your path has been set
And to this you will see it through

Dividing the flesh and the essence
While dying - you see as you should
But could never see
Fleeing the host - panic frenzy
Your last breaths to be counted
And faint images fade as hope loses its worth

Drug-addict Christian minds, waiting to be manipulated
Sheep to follow the teacher, but you were the first one lost, cunt...
Destructive, driven by demons - Christfucking the temple above
I now have you blindfolded on your knees...

This is the end of your fairytale
The crown is deep in your skin

I shall carry you in a cage of claws and flesh
Till the dusk of time - to face his rise in darkness

Abandoned, Terror filled, Disgraced
This will be your hell, no redemption
Tears of fright...

Nuclearchrist
Vomitpig!

I curse the stars
And your fire desecrating the wishes of all
In a pool of piss and blood I drown you
And I will laugh until I vomit and my eyes are dead

Conquering the swamps follow his light
He shows me the way, is my guide
Descending like a vulture these bottomless cliffs

The sun never burnt this god's wings

(I curse the stars) and your fire
Desecrating the wishes of all
In a pool of piss and blood I drown you
And I will laugh until I vomit and my eyes are dead

Conquering the swamps follow his light
He shows me the way is my guide
Descending like a vulture these bottomless cliffs

A god with horns...

I curse your scars and your desire
Bitter creator, conqueror destructor
No resurrection no crystal spirit lifeform
You spoke lies of salvation and triumph

Trapped in this twisted
Vision world of yours
You are the god and king
(Incarnated in one)

Deprive me the disgust of eyes
For I have no mirror in your kingdom
The fall is harder than ever
Drowning in this river
That never seems to end

Gates of black open before me
...Undead
I am no longer your son...
I spit in your face
The taste of my fury
Angelcunt whores raped

Your life gift collapsed like blood in me
And now this blasphemy is my offer

Once foretold through scriptures of a time now past
Etchings scribed in complex tongues hidden from man
A tale unfolds depicting an eternal war
For ages sealed, now unleashed; a timeless horror

One final set, a light-giving star buried by darkness
Sinking below the earth, the sun shall now forever rest

Doomed to wage an endless battle
A conflict fought but never settled
Buried flesh long since perished
Lies beneath this destined quarrel

A battle fought between an abandoned earth
And its birth-giver, the timeless universe

Sinister, unsacred
From ruptured veins flow the names
Mortality untwined
Blood-written texts unleash the untamed

Howling passage pours from the open wound
Awakening the flesh form of chaos
A million eyes forced ajar
Enraged by their disturbed slumber

Planar invocation, a rift reveals abominations
Hideous deformities, marching legion summoned forth
revelling in suffering; sentries wail upon rebirth
Cold moon dawns a time of death, as horrid souls wake from their rest

Angry forces bring darkness to the daylight sky
Monstrous armies summoned by scriptures and sacrifice
Thirst for life-blood builds in their empty insides
Bodies shed their skin as they prepare to die

Rumble of attacking soldiers; hordes of beasts arrive
Hateful legions born to conquer, enemies arise

...Alone...
...Scared...
...Empty...
...Once King...

Blood running down your fingers,
Last minute thoughts,
Dripping on the floor.
Corpse collapsing in a pile.

From your rotting and open flesh,
Armies of worms swarm out,
Like waves of black water,
Emptying you from inside.

Until the white of bones,
Rises above your bloated cadaver.

For the first time your existence
Is overwhelmed with life and beauty

Redemptive Immolation, Redemptive Self-sacrifice

Your body for once is a vessel to receive,
But the angels of joy are now silent,
The angels of joy are now in agony,
As they gaze upon this shrine of Holy Death.

Dead wind howling
Bodies bend like trees
Praying, kneeling, worshiping

Thousands of them crying for salvation
Hoping, gazing, dying

Robbing their corpses
Stripping them under the eye of their savior
With open arms…

Dead wind ceased, bodies cracked like twigs
Decayed orthodox obscurantism, our vindication
Doing the Devil’s work.

As if they were tearing through my flesh, it was embedded in my mind
That Jesus died for me...How foolish can they be

As if they were tearing through my flesh, it was embedded in my mind
Jesus didn't die for me...
Jesus died

How foolish can they be to worship such a king
Who was crowned and hung between two thieves

In hopes of his return, we congregate in prayer
A faith so strong it obscured us from the truth

Your cross was my enslaver
Nails that held me close
Your precious blood was shed
And I don't accept your pain

Monarch of deceit on a cross of hope and fear
Not a symbol of your sanctity
But a reminder of your defeat

As you were nailed and killed
So were we nailed to gold
We live upon your cross and bear this guilt for you

How foolish can they be to worship such a king
Who was crowned and hung between two thieves

As you were nailed and killed
So were we nailed to gold

Behind the walls of Christ
The hypocrites recite songs to glorify
Their king who's died in vain
They betray the holy son

Extinguishing his light
Their greed and their desire
Have torn him from his cross

They took down upon us
As their God looks down upon them
And sees them for what they are

Devoted to their saints and all their hails to Mary
Confessions show their weakness
Pathetic show of faith
They ease their guilt
Through the Rosary
Their false display of pity
Condemns the God they praise

Their words of adoration
Spewing from their lips
Lie far from their hearts
Their insincere tears
Fall from lying eyes
They'll never see his kingdom
They'll burn with Jesus

Their words of adoration
Spewing from their lips
Lie far from their hearts
Their insincere tears
Fall from lying eyes
They'll never see his kingdom
They'll burn with Jesus

They took down upon us
As their God looks down upon them
And sees them for what they are

Alone
Without warmth
Without light
But how do I see in this darkness
Death feeds upon me
The condemned under my feet
Eternity has passed us by

Everyone is here
The ones I've loved and hated
All of us in pain...together

In a timeless void of anguish
Where sorrow is like breathing
and with every breath I hurt more and more

The fallen and trampled
Damned to spend eternity here

Constant burning souls
In a sea of writhing flesh
Endless plains
Of sin and deprivation

Those of wealth and might, of humble and weak
Those who gave way to uphold God's will
He who has conquered and he who has failed
The wicked and the holy in utter desolation
In this absence of being, misery consumes
Existing not living, I am dead yet I feel in total seclusion
I am left to ponder the empty promises of your shallow God

The sounds of anguish...so loud
Their sobbing...like thunder
Pierces through me...and crushes me
Again... and again... and again... and again... and again

So vast this pain
More unbearable it becomes
With every passing moment
I pray for an end

In a timeless void of anguish
Where sorrow is like breathing
And with every breath I hurt more and more

Your prayers,
I don't feel them in my heart
It is not hate
That I stare coldly at the son of god
I can not force the blood of Christ
To flow through me
God is love and his love is dead

I feel...

Drown your sorrows in prayer
But your prayers will never change the world
I separate myself
From those who chase the spirit
I can't fall to my knees
And pretend like all the rest
This is a soul that doesn't need saving

I feel... nothing, nothing

Their paradise not mine; an illusion I will not believe
Divine presence of perfection, turns sour in my gaze
Why should I feel compassion for the suffering of your God
For all the pain he allows, I give him what he deserves

In the name of the Father,
In the name of the Son
Where is the Holy Spirit, I feel nothing
As I stare upon the crucifix, I feel nothing for a God I never knew
I refuse to embrace, and live by his word

I take not of his body
I take not of his blood
I don't need salvation
Or his forgiveness
I don't want his kingdom
My kingdom is here

I feel... nothing, nothing

Many times I've kneeled before the lord not knowing he was at my feet
Why my pain, why my tears
Only now to see you were just man

You sit and watch, in all your splendor
oh creator, it's you I now renounce
Everloving God, your love has failed me
I don't need your love...

Jesus, you couldn't save me
You couldn't save them
You couldn't save the world from misery

Hate my sin, Love my pain
You made us suffer, to your delight
To feel your anguish, will be my strength
Your broken kingdom, shall fall below

Once a time when I yearned to be at one with the Lord

Cheated by your false claims of divinity
I defy your word and rise in your disdain
to revoke you of your dominion
I am the darkness of the world

You couldn't save me
You couldn't save them
You couldn't save the world from misery

Savior and Healer
The water you walked is drowning me

With glimpses of the highest reward
And the depths of the overwhelming promise
I confront him, the heavens before me
God fleeing, his presence swept away

Death He Lied!

To the most high, above all
They cower in his might
But now, in his nakedness and shame
He falls...

Fallen king... to endure
Ceaseless pain... world is dead
Mighty God... pulling down

The heavens divide, revealing a light
From out of the sky, their savior appears
The figure adorned in wonder and brilliance
Plummeting down, falling to earth
In horror they watch, it was all just a lie
As light turns to black, devours their hope... and faith

Mighty God...pulling down
Casting down... everything high
and bringing you... towards earth

Death

Cold darkness, swallows life
Heavens promise, stolen light
Now to suffer with their fallen Christ

Blood to dust, flesh to dirt
To the earth, they lie
Light of God, never seen

Death

To the most high, from below
They cower in his might
But now in triumphant glory
Rejoice the fall of God

Towards Earth

Might God...pulling down
Casting down...everything high
And bringing you...towards earth

Mighty God...consume the light
Casting down...your pathetic Christ
And bringing them...towards Hell

Death He Lied!

Martyrs of the cross, bear the flames of hate
The madness in their eyes is blind to their obsession
The judgments they bestow... in God's name

Abolish the impious, conquering their fate
Driven by beliefs they enforce upon the weak to justify the life...they've destroyed.

For control of the soil, sacred grounds of faith
Soaking in the blood, the blood of their redemption
Longing for deliverance...from sin

Apostles of perversion, the suffering they induce
Thrive upon the carnage, take pleasure in their pain
They offer no atonement...for they're his chosen

Take the weak...Make them see
Our blessed ways...Died for God

Sickening...Benevolence
Twisted...Conviction

On the shores of Armageddon, the defeated bow their heads
Silent are their prayers, silent are the heavens
Their somber eyes have seen the coming of the beast.

Behold the loss of life and the triumphs of death
The fall of man and God, a penance for devotion
Feel the fury of his everlasting retribution

Captives of faith,
His image never fading from their eyes
Imprisoned by their own creation
It grows stronger, distorts and confines
Behind the gates, the worshiped oppressor
To which weak minds fall
To a God in a godless world

Obeying him...serving him
The golden gates, only surrounding him

Crushed by the weight of devotion through the hails of a dying trinity
Within these bars they'll wait an eternity
For the coming of a dead messiah
In passion they adore, embodied with lies
Tempted by the world, carry out their lives
As they press against the bars, steel upon their flesh
Possessed by the one they call lord.

They'll live and die within his cage
His followers locked in steel

Christ's Cage Christ

Where they leave their sin
Where they worship him
They see more than what he is
In his cage they are his slaves

Empty and silent...barren his kingdom
He will perish...alone in heaven
Gates of gold, now his cage

Christ's Cage Christ

A world in chaos, a people lost
Days of sorrow, days of bedlam
Anticipate it's coming, world upheaval
The darkness upon us, soon to come

At the coming of the dawn
No one hears our dying cries
Our somber vigils nevermore

From humble beginnings comes the one
To lead us blindly into the night
Obscure and prophetic, his rise to God
Many will perish in the wake of this savior

As we near our final days
Will we see beyond the dark
Has our blood been shed in vain

You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
When he reveals himself
When he reveals himself
You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
He sees within your hearts
He sees within your souls

A people divided
Turn on each other
No one shall rival
Our new found messiah

And all shall follow
And heed his calling
Ensure his reign
Will span the heavens

He'll rise...
We'll fall...
His rule...
Our end...

At the coming of the dawn
We've seen into the dark
In the shadow of the beast
We'll close our eyes one final time

You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
When he reveals himself
When he reveals himself
You will all be fooled
You will all be fooled
He sees within your hearts
He sees within your souls

No Christ...no cross, no pain...no loss
No wanton guilt for us to bear
No body...no blood, no crown...no thorns
No bastard son, no chosen one

I count the days
When the oppressed are released
The ending of his reign
No Jesus, No Beast

No pits of sin to languish in
No path of just for us to follow
No foolish prayer and seething lies
No virgin birth on pagan earth

I await the time
When our hatred is unleashed
He'll rule no more
No Jesus, No Beast

Leader of fools
Creator of sin
Extractor of hope
Deceiver of truth

Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus
Can you hear us...Death to Jesus

As horizons overcast with menacing formations
Those who will stand are committed no more
Icon of icons, shattered and overtaken
This Bastard, this Beast, this Jesus must die

Die

No Christ...no cross, no pain...no loss
No wanton guilt for us to bear
No body...no blood, no crown...no thorns
No bastard son, no chosen one

I count the days
When the oppressed are released
The ending of his reign
No Jesus, No Beast

Have faith in their words
From your weakness they are born
Messiahs to the masses
But failures for all

Send millions to worship
Send millions to die
Devoted, they follow in blindness
Lost, they can not find their way

Eminent...immortal
Crowned by our hands

Bringers of terror, all will cower in fear
Bringers of war, their people perish and die
Bringers of plague, the faithful wither and fade
Bringers of famine, the hunger grows and grows
Cure not our ills...
Feed on our souls...

Promise eternity...

Eternity never comes...

Their lies will lull the chaos
While humanity falls around them
Impoverished, in droves they'll grovel
In confusion and fear they flourish

They've failed to lead the way out of darkness
Their words mean nothing, your gods are dead

Let them rape you
Let them rule you
They will take you
You're failures for gods

No promised land
No love towards man
No perfect end
You're failures for gods

Can they not see the deception and the tyranny
So desperate they've become the victims not the victors
Can they not see the tragedy in their beliefs
The failures you worship are the failures you've become

Eminent...immortal
Crowned by our hands

Shining with hues of magnificent splendor
Leading the way, revere him
The righteous, the saved
Hand in hand, poised in rapture
Blissful delusion, believe in forever
Choirs of angels strike chords of transgression

How you are like your savior
With souls impure and vile
Rescued from our presence
Your fall will be divine
Behold, the days of righteousness are coming
For wicked are the hearts of men and gods
Cleanse yourselves, step out of the light

Purge me of Christ...empowered, unsaved
Humble before him...the price for their saving

Don't pray for my soul for I'll rise above you
My hatred is my strength and through this I'll conquer
The fear and the weakness I see in your eyes

Touched by the divine
They hide in the light
Adorn me with his crown

The ways of the blessed
Scourging mankind
Such reverence and obedience
As we drown in his filth

The fires of depravity
Are burning with vigor
Professing his name to all

Writhing and crying, for a savior you're calling
Wretched and broken, humanity is falling
Selfish and wicked, you rape and you take

Reach up and take the hand of God,
For everything he touches is turned to shit
Follow him into glory,
Leave behind the Eden that you've ravaged
Filthy Christians,
Will your crosses help you cleanse your filthy souls
Filthy liars,
Wallow in the dimming light of promise

Laughing and beaming, revel in our ruin
Turning his back, shakes our blood from his hands
A world in denial of being denied

Will you ever see the rivers of black spilling from his wounds
Will you ever hear the somber wails of winds that carry hope
Can you crawl from beneath the layers of his filth

The fires of depravity
Still burning and burning
Professing and declaring
His kingdom on earth

Father in heaven, a desolate kingdom
His paradise, his promise, a faded flame extinguished by the dark
Lifetimes of devotion...eternities of nothing
The place for which you long, eludes and embitters

In the hands of fools and liars...trade your lives for grace
Your souls are weak and empty, now kiss his throne of sorrow
From crooked tongues...tales of pristine glory
Consumed by flames it burns, the fall of the holy kingdom

So high...
Absurd...
Sickening...is the stench of high heaven

Through the clouds, through the lies
You'll never see what's never been
At the passing of life and the coming of death
Pass not through its gates, but into the dark

No light...
No love...
No glory...
No heaven...

Fallen has the king... fallen has the kingdom
Fall into uplifted arms below
The stench of heaven... lingers above
Sour is the air, but soon the air will clear

Angel of beauty
Angel of the spirit
Come down and walk among us
Let the spirit die within you
Shed your ties to God
Shed your holy grace
Come down and walk among us
Be tempted by the flesh

Denounce he who keeps you
Turn away from his light
Let your eyes feast upon
The debauchery that awaits
Indulge in your desires
Taste the fruits of sin
Angel of the spirit
Become one of the flesh

I will tempt you
Child of light
Show your weakness
Child of God

Revolted by its weakness
So easily corrupted
Let us plague you with perversion
You've become what you abhor
No longer will you know
The raptures of the heavens
But instead what you will see
Is the sickness of the world

Taste the sweetness of the flesh
Let it feed your vestal needs
Taste the sweetness of desire
Your wings will burn and turn to dust

The flesh is crude, this flesh is evil
Forever banished to flesh and blood
Abandon he who commands the light
forsake the holy spirit

This flesh is crude, this flesh is evil
Forever banished to flesh and blood
Abandon he who commands the light
Forsake the holy spirit

You will feel the charms of lust
Know the pain of loss
Envy what's not yours
And covet with selfish greed
Now flesh of my flesh
Open to my hunger
Permeate your pureness
With the corrupted seed of humanity

I will tempt you
Child of light
Show your weakness
Child of sin

Cold and empty
His essence malign
This absence of light
Casts out and condemns...
God's will

His soul, his essence
Lives inside us
This wretched mark
Has stained our souls...
Forever

Through us his war is won
Victorious over God and his son
Persuasive and dominant his presence
Shall break the strongest of wills
The devout can't endure his storms
Grant passage into our world

His shadow will consume and feed
Upon your blessed trinity
Cripple and erase its curse
Bring upon the end of faith
Until your savior comes again
To prove his death was not his end
He'll come alive through our beliefs
We hear his laughter through our tears

His cries of glory as we stray from the light
Defeated and shamed, chastised and silent
Angels, and Saints, and God forgotten
The path to heaven ends at conception
Our souls will fall far below the clouds

Through us his war is won
Victorious over God and his son
Persuasive and dominant his presence
Shall break the strongest of wills
The devout can't endure his storms
Grant passage into our world

Burdened by the world, too weak to deal with life
Bow to show your love, bow to show devotion
Drowning in the sickness that vomits forth deceit
Fear not what is said, but fear what you believe

Ravaged by their words and into their open arms
Like thieves they'll steal your mind and use it to control
An endless sea of faces, an endless sea of loss
Take your place in line and serve them until the end

Do you think you follow greatness
Do you think you follow the divine

Do you think you are the chosen
Do you think you are the few

A genocide of faith
The faithful wait their turn

Just like slaves... hand in hand
Just like ghosts... souls in hand

You take their lives
You take our hearts
You have no shame

You shake the world
Dramatic stage
For your own gain

You say you're men
We know you're cowards
You pitiful fools
The true strong remain

Just like slaves... hand in hand
Just like ghosts... now you're damned

Our course is our own, I know we're to blame
We're born into shame, to live in despair
I feel such pity for what we've become
Our needs and desires...our weakness, our pain
Our need to fulfill, the urges we feel
It weakens our will, it brings us great pain
A flood of hatred surges inside
Control it, deny it...let it run free

I can't run away...I can't hide from myself
It is what I am...it is what we are

Look around and see...pathetic human beasts
We have written our own ending

How can we live with ourselves
Our jealousy, our tyranny
The lives we make, the lives we take
The fools we serve, the fools we are

Brazen in our final days
Our time on top is near on end
It's clear to me we'll never change
It's clear that I will never change
The tragedy of life we live
The tragedy of life we'll see
We call it human nature
The seducer of mankind

Our course is our own, I know we're to blame
We're born into shame, to live in despair
A flood of hatred surges inside
Control it, deny it...let it run free

I can't run away...I can't hide from myself
It is what I am...it is what we are
Look around and see...pathetic human beasts
We have written our own ending

How can we live with ourselves
Our jealousy, our tyranny
The lives we make, the lives we take
The fools we serve, the fools we are

It feels like we're blind...
It feels like we're dead
We'll never find our way...
We'll never feel the light of day

Don't try to think...
Don't try to live your own life
We have you for keeps...
Our ways are sewn deep in your hearts and minds

The colors have faded... everything's black
Darkness around me... darkness inside me

Your blood line stops here...
We are your family now
Prepare for the end... a new life awaits us beyond

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see
Humanity struggles to be free

Are you willing to die for us
Are you willing to die with us

Strip us down to nothing and use us as you wish
Like little pawns you move around at your fingertips
We beg to serve and serve you well, you keep us in the dark
Hold us close and suffocate the souls you've led astray

The cycle's complete... the pieces for ruin are in place
Our subjects are ready... to seal our date with infamy

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see
Humanity struggles to be free

I am the one...leader of promise
Stalking lost souls
Rabid for the taste of faith

Pull you close to me...I will make you see
Spit my fears into your hearts
Feed your minds with my disease

I'll make them doubt themselves
I'll make you loathe yourself

I am the one...creature of moves
Sending my pack out into the world
Those loyal to me grow like a plague

They'll bow in praise of me...they will be slaves to me
I will bring them to their knees
Devoured soul by soul

I'll make them fight for me
I'll make them die for me

You'll feed me your young and I take them with pride
I'll offer you some guilt and a lifetime of lies
Let me tease you with wonders and surround you with me
For I shall be your life, and your life shall be for me

I'm your world, I'm your light, I am all the answers you seek
You'll walk throughout your empty lives, but never challenge me
For I am god, I am every God, I'm whatever you wish of me
I'm the beast you've created, and I'm the beast you'll serve

I'll make them fight for me
I'll make them die for me

Reluctant messiah, show us the way
Don't let us down, we have no one left
Your unwillingness to prove, what we believe
The signs you won't leave, we still seem to find

Such distance between us, but we know you are here
We feel your presence, it guides us along
But why won't you answer or send us some hope
We'll just keep searching for what we know is there

Why has our day not yet come
We've sacrificed our fathers and sons
We spill blood but shed not a tear
Our anger grows, but so does our fear

Speak to us...
What have we done wrong
We just want to believe
In something larger than life itself
Speak to us...
Let us know your voice
We just want you to see
Our faith is true
We just want you to see
Our faith is true

What more can we do...
He must feel our devotion
Will he know the righteous from the fallen...
Will he know we're the first in line
Save us from our fate...
Save us from our faith

The kingdom falls and with it
Goes the darkness of the world
Its malignant soul had burned
So bright in the glory of its day
Wars were fought in its name
And life was cast aside
So many lives were sacrificed
To keep the kingdom strong

The kingdom falls and with it goes the shadow
That it cast
Its king alone
To stand in shame, a symbol of the past
The pulse that beat for centuries
Had died out long ago
And now divided the people see
The truth behind the show

Watch them scramble for cover
Watch them try to hold it together
Frantic to stop its collapse
But change has finally come

Divided it will fall
Its fabric rips and tears
The beating of its heart
Will never again be heard

Foundation built on the flesh of the past
Twisting its purpose through years of neglect
Conflict of power, true soldiers are scarce
A kingdom divided will not stand

The kingdom falls and with it goes
The arrogance it reeked
The darkness that was hidden deep now on the surface flows
Humbled now before the world it shows its ugly face
Tear this cancer from the world and purge it from our lives

Not all of us choose to believe
Some of us choose to live
Not all of us follow so blindly
And accept all that we hear

Maybe you're not so smart
To look outside yourself
Maybe you've chosen unwisely
In the God you've made your own

I'll be my own leader
I'll be my own savior
I'll be the strength that carries
I'll be the light that guides...me
I will make you see
Your devotion is in vain
I'll be the one left standing
When all of you are kneeling
And smiling, so content
I'll wipe the smiles off your faces

Don't you dare pity me
I've made my choice and I'll prove you wrong

My voice will thunder through the heavens
And my flames of hatred burn
I believe in me and only me
And I bow to no sovereign

Looking down from on top of it all
Looking down on everyone else
So high above, it all looks the same
Bring you down to see how it is

The greatness you feel, so smug on your throne
Your view of it all is clouded and warped
Clearly you'll see how it unfolds
Brought down from above to see how it is

Don't you feel passion
Don't you know love
The bitterness that drives you
Will hurt us all

Down with the righteous, down with the liars
Down with the leaders who rape their own men
Down with your idols, down with your ideals
Down with the thieves who rob us of life

King to king, so hungry for power
Fortress to fortress with no ground to gain
On missions of hatred that lead us to ruin
A course that would change if we bring them down

Down to the sorrow, down to the crying
Brought down to the suffering, now how does it feel
Down to the horror, down to the screaming
Brought down to the silence they'll hear in the end

Call us the Devil
But it's you who holds the darkest heart
Call the weak to arms
Savage words to your savage world

Abusing control... Menacing all

Call yourself the victim
But it's you who walks the vicious path
Call them to the mayhem
For you they'll lay down with the dead

Rabid conviction... Uphold the threat

A swarm of terror
Across the land
Spreading sickness to curse the world

Punishing judgment
Will bring the end
Cast the nightmare to take down mankind

A swarm of terror
Across the land
Spreading sickness to curse the world

Child of promise
Where are you now?
Our savior sleeps
Awake for us

Your miracles are needed now
Carry us out of harm's way if you can

His children weep
And cry his name
Our savior sleeps
Why won't he rise?

Carry us as you said you would
Through the dark that clouds our world

We trusted you
But you did not come through
The suffering you left with us
Will torture our lives forever

Child of promise
Where are you now?
Our savior sleeps
Eternal night

Carry us as you said you would
Through the dark that clouds our world

Miles to suffer
So much before us
Confusion follows
Fills the air

The struggle ahead
Will change us all
Shock our conscious
Test our strengths

Walk through the fire
Force our steps
Weaken our hearts
With chilling screams of death

Dead is creeping at our backs
We dread to think what lies ahead

Hysteria exploding all around us
Flames that touch the sky
Numbing fear takes over
Prepare yourself
For the worst is yet to come

Cascading down like rain
Our blood, our hopes, our being

Learn to breathe
The aggression in
It thrives in you
Must forge on
We believe
This must be done
Embracing madness
We must forge on

Forward moving, never slowing
A soulless machine that hungers for victory
Tear through the soil, tear through the soul
Power in motion, daunting procession

Swift and cunning...
Striking down the opposition
Stand and fight...
Resist its might and be erased

Rolling forward, like thunder for glory
Seizing the day, seizing the night
All or nothing, and all it will take
Breathing its chaos over the land

Raining down...
A storm of fire, intimidating
Its poison touches all...
For generations to come

Cutting the throats and bleeding all hopes
Tireless and savage, preying on fear
Courting death, while trampling life
Exist for the battle, live for the war

Assume no blame...
The blood it sheds, a purpose served
And when it's done...
We'll call it back to march again

You've left me in the filth
You've left me here to die... Why?

Look at how you've broken me
Can't you see what you have done?
Is it the Devil in you
Or just a selfish heart?

So much loyalty
But devotion had a price
I carried you, I held you up
But you tried to drag me down
All the fatal blows you've thrown at me
You rubbed it in my face
Now you are dead to me
Your death will set me free

Miles I've walked for you
But you've given not a step
Remember all I've done
How quickly we forget
You've taken me away
So far from who I was
And almost pulled my soul
Right out from under me

You've cast a thousand lashes
I never said a word
Another thousand lashes
Left me screaming at the world

Free
Now I'm free
You're dead to me
Now I'm free

All will hear my voice
Change the course of time
My fury disrupts the world
Reward me with wonders beyond my dreams

So easy for me to believe
So easy for me to see
That the path I'm walking down
Was chosen for me

When the time has come, all will know my name
And with these hands I will own the day
Tearing down the sun, leave my youth behind
Only just a child, I will shed my life
My innocence made me easy prey
Stole my thoughts and fed me theirs
Another faceless child, another holy solider
Ripped apart by lies and sent into their war

I'm too far gone, it's taken control of me
There's no turning back
My time has finally come
For this moment, I am God

I've sacrificed my life for you
And given everything I was
Revere this precious gift of mine
Your son will never rise again

The world will watch me die
In a blaze of twisted glory
Will you remember what I have done
Or forget that I was your son?

I can feel the weakness in you
It's just a matter of time
Once I have control
You'll never be the same

I make your question faith
Put your morals to the test
Bend you into submission
My essence you can not fight

I'll show you things you've never seen
Expose the darkness deep within
Taste and feel a different world
Leave behind all you were

New heights of passion
And the pleasures of pain
Show no compassion, show no remorse
My helpless slave, do as I say
Indulge in me to the end

Taunting
And destructive
Go ahead
You know you want it
Feel temptation
Just give in
Taste it once
You won't go back

The easy path was clear to see
The choice you made has brought you here
Your broken life in front of me
Spiral down into my arms

Believe in the liar
His words will convey
Profound and charismatic
Influence all to his side

Tell them what they want to hear
Keep the wolves at bay
Swallow all the truth
And spit deception out

Together we'll pave the way
To his omnipotence
Calming all dissension
Dissuading intervention

Hiding sanity - strangling reason
Remove his wicked tongue - or face the consequence

Divide and conquer... uproot and tear down... the world is his
Provide the cause... cause the effect... create the hatred
Extort our passions... extort our strengths... force our hand
Distort our vision... distort your promise... bending glory

Undo the world - unleash its fury
Release our demons - infect us all with your venom

We saw it coming and watched him rise
We did nothing to stop this mess
A fool's kingdom, a fool's king
We raised the liar and crowned the beast

The lives of many... on the heels of victory... will know defeat
He led us blindly... so blind in anger... we could not see
The cries of reason... so loud their cries... fell on deaf ears
We'll bear the scars... and take the pain... for one more day

Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it closing in?
Looming all around us
A horror waiting to begin
Smell it in the air
A sense of havoc growing strong
The tides about to turn
Poised to take us down

And one by one we'll fall... giants side by side
And one by one we'll fall... the irony of our end

Rage of silence builds
A calm that's so deceitful
We're our own prey
Watching the night fall
We can not stop this
It pulls us under
The tides now turning
Poised to strike us down

And one by one we'll fall... we'll slowly disappear
And one by one we'll fall... our darkest day draws near

We had it in our hands, we thought we had the power
But control was an illusion that finally defied us
Took it all for granted, too little was too late
Finally catching up to us, grandeur has a heavy cost

Burn the world around us, incinerate the skies
Fading into nothing, but what did we expect?
Now the final fury of our final hours
In awe of what we've done, so beautiful to watch

Confront me unholy ones
Bastard saints scorn of the earth
I summon thee now poison me
Death under will burn in my soul

Exalt me enemies of the lamb
Intrude - We are of one
Under will, I walk the path of sin
With your spells I die again

Raise me from mortal
My will be your will
My words speak your words
Your pains raise me to bliss

What of this anger now
Received to lance your enemy
I feel the energy
The poison moves in me
I spill blood

Scorn of the earth, I witness
In rapture I'm born again
Scorn of the light, I bear scorn
In rapture I'm reborn

Release this fury
Malediction
Cursed existence
Writhing in this life of dissent
Pain for pleasure
Pain for adoration
Pain is to godliness
Bleeding for Ecstasy

Pain Divine

Locked in vicious
Offer to the gods
Nails driven through my dreams
Bleeding - Pain is a god's reward

Gliding through these dungeons
Heightened senses overwhelmed
Hedonistic rupture
Endurance makes one divine

Bred from the bowels Sheep one and all
Bound by the doctrine of lies
To fucked human shit, I shout blasphemy!
As I make my way thru to
The promised land

Smell of shit is so foul
Writhe in disgust
Earth heaves and death comes to call
All the waste - Cling to your lie
You are as sand and the wind blows
My disgust - A fever
To kill a thousand more

Gene dead from birth
God's holy fuck Canonized but of no use to me
Human shit, untermensch, waste begone from my earth!!

Desolation - No life bodies littering
Beast of earth devour!
Cleanse this world for those who deserve

Burning cities, all is well
I remain in my conviction
As the waste in sewer flows thru the promised land

Naught within this circle
All but emptiness expelled
I am deep in wicked
And whore to demons works
Master - I call thee
Master - Surround me
With evil in our hearts
This night we take revenge

Mote it be
Satan's sword I have become
No son shall escape
No word left unburned
The power is in me
Hellspawn in aeturnum
I burn with hate
To rid the world of
The Nazarene

This night of splendor
The beast arise in me
This is my destiny
My sword shall take life

Beasts awaiting, restless
Circus victims panic struck
Hunger spawns bestial frenzy
Commencement of the feast
By the sign of the cross

Whips crack
Centurians might be known
Christians standing breathless
Circus victims panic struck
Scream Arena butchery
Where is their god as the
Faithful meet their end?

Judgement has passed
Who questions this law?
Pagan belief of sacrifice

Kill them all
Kill them all for slander
Kill them all and mute their ways

Death to my vision
Blind I shall serve
Give rise to god war
Watch the civils fall

Hateful seed inside me
Scald my mind of all but truth
I concede; I am the chosen one
Open wide the gate
Stain the world with the blood of man

Affliction
Forced unto all
Human Vexation
Transcend with blood on my hands

Spirits of the grave remember
Rise up O powers from the land 
Plague and madness spread thru this world
Burn in me - I suffer your will

Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning black
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the alter, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days

They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu
Carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church

Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within leather noose
Sing the ancient hymn that makes the Absu roll
Raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of Kingu

Sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
Priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate

Angel of disease one who shuns the light
Goat with one thousand young

Praise the beast, the chanting grew
Praise the beast with virgin blood
Praise the beast with soul and mind
Praise the beast and show the sign

Bind their kings in iron chains
Execute the judgement for them
Come and taste the fleshy pleasures
Orgies of endless time

Beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
From their graves the dead rise to answer the call
On a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
They blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods

Morbid priest calling forth
Abominations of the sky
Meets in the void
Ancient Ones rule once more

Spawn of the ever rolling abyss
Ever espousing unluminous
Charred soul - Burned at rebirth
Quest not save the death of the sun

Repulsed by the light
Heart pumping ice
So cold to this world
Reclude until the summoning
Sworn to the black

Our father begotten, not made
Before all legends of man
Receive my loyalty, my offering
In my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
Summon me

Burning inside, I feel the call
Blood of the Ancient Ones now boils
At war - War with the race
Father rise and the world be one

Repulsed by the light
No feeling for life
Drained of my being
I lie dead but still I'm sworn

Lies - And you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive?
So, What makes you supreme?
Lies - Your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, you creator are
Blind with envy

Let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Thru my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and You'll
Be like me
In emptiness, free

Just bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly

The killing is a need rots in the pain.
Fight for the fear of rights.
The time is set, scream for their help.
Cry through the darkest night.

The peeling is the skin rotting the soul.
Hailing for the chosen son.
Mortality the pain, fearing for the living.
Revenge the chosen one.

The darkness falls beyond the grave.
Blessing ground in which they save.
Even though the time has passed.
The souls are fried tonight in hell.

Rotting souls in fear of desperate need.
Serpent souls in bowels on which to feed.
The devil dog is out for blood and parts.
The devil craves the blood we're thirsting on.

Help me I'm in pain.
Help me I'm in pain.

A stab in the back
With a fearless knife
With no regard
To an innocent life

Ruthlessly killing
We're terrified (What terrible fun)
Now that your falling
With nowhere to run

Back to the one
That you fear is dead
The nightmare returns
So it's sliced thru your head

Warmly embraced
You will soon go away
The bloodsoaked heads
And the destitute say
Back to one

Falling to your death down below
You're dying it's the pain no one will ever know
Crawling toward the goodness of the light
You're crying out after those who may stop this fight

Not the one
Souls are gonna burn
You're the one
Coming down the dead

Thru the darkness
Skies are gonna shout
Pray for lies
But who's the one to go

Streams of blood
Flow into the streets
Feeds the need
Of the decayed rotting means

Fires breeds upon
The weary young
Evil tales
Sold his only son

Life no longer
Fills the need
Dead silence
In which to feed

Fires breeds upon
The weary young
Evil tales
Sold his only son

Life no longer
Feeds the need
Feeds the need
Of the decayed rotting means

No will to live
Without lights
Coming to the end of life

Arriving in the end of life
Ones decide to sacrifice

No will to live
Without lights
Coming to the end of life

Lost in darkness realms to go
The fearless ones now are down
The final one is burnt off life

Some say you're choosing to fight.
And some say you're scheduled to live or die.
And some say you're scheduled to kill
Laughing at what they will do.

What if they are right
To lift the fate of everyone.
Let them live in pain.
A pain to which there is no end.

As I look to the right.
I see the horror filled within.
Killing is the meaning of life.
Killing is a way to leave your body

A mean to release your fear.
A fear of sickness down within.
Let the guilty pay.
A pain to which there is no end.

Back from the grave.
I took the life of everyone.
And from the bottom of the grave.
I took the death of everyone.

To those who fear their right.
You are the first sight then filled with fear.
A fear that begins to mount
The fear that turns you inside out.

Into the realms of no way out.
Into a life of the utter doubt.
A place in which you won't exist.
A place in which you're living dead.
Side B

As you begin to fall.
A terror with these that fear.
A trust in your beliefs.
Be forced to no release.

The corrosion fills your mind, your mind.
Your eyes turn to stone.
A killer becomes in you.
Rotting soul's desire.

Arising in the dark
a peeling soul to pay
Crawling for the light
Piercing through your brain
Reaching out for help
The help in which you pray
Searching for the answers
To questions which they say
Just Killing Time

Killing time is the final bout
Life slowly decays
From the depths of down below
Powerful rotting ways
Corpses lay out on the ground
Form a perfect line
Killing Time

Rotten is the deadly birth
Strength turns to fear
Searching for the end result
Life's death draws near
A falling victim to decay
Infection sets the pace
Rising from your loneliness
And the human race

You will soon come with me to die,
And find that death is not the end.
Who I say, who will, who won't be freed.
Tell me that this is not the end complete.

Even as the end's complete.
Finding strength in one's defeat.
Living in an endless score.
Killing me with battled sores.

I'm the one that's sent to kill,
Feeling all destructive will.
Bring forth one dead soul's decay,
The end's complete, it's the final day.

When the time has come to bare,
Dying young, fall to despair.
To bring forth one dead soul decay,
The end completes the final day.

The terror fills my mind.
Cannot prevent what's mine.
Silence life that's sent.
Fearing the souls, of fate.
Death decides rotting ways.

Rotting ways, fear of death the signs from below.
Rotting ways, fear that bleeds with lives sought low.

The fear has come beyond the rotting ways.
Now the time writes down the days.

They're coming for the glory of the kill without a sound.
Mystery sinks into, back into the ground.

Terror fills my mind.
Cannot prevent what's mine.
Silence life that's sent.
Fearing the souls of fate.
Death decides rotting ways

You've found once, live wise.
The taste to come, we'll go.
Lost right taking the face, the coming show.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.

I will fear rising forms more slow.
Live the spell, takes the coming spell forth.
Ravishing you all.
Ravishing you all.
Ravishing you all.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.

You've found once, live wise.
The taste to come, we'll go.
Lost right taking the face, the coming show.

Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.
Threatening skies.

Destiny, feel disgrace.
I'm the one that's fallen.
I'm the one in pain.
I'm the one that's going.
Forces decay in pain, by the light.

The suffer is cold.
There's colors
Searing his face.

Drifting through the sorrow.
The visions yet display.
It strips the soul completely empty.
Sirens rage in vain.

Drifting through the sadness.
Violence fills the sky.
Torturing, the voice rang out.
My servants they are blind, by the light.

Suffer is cold.
There's colors
Searing his face.
By the light.
By the light.
By the light.

The feeling contends, once kind.
Violence starts, won't cease.
Vengeance comes. Want rewards.
The servant starts piercing chores.

Stitching mouths, once skinned.
The gaping wounds left to mend.
Reckless kills, live despite.
Boundary has soldiers try.

I have come to read my friend
The gifts of all those born and bred.
The living dead once more resign.
We're facing cause it's creation.

I have come to resist life's scar in pain.
The fates just called in Armageddon.
Infected, for the scraps are red.
Deep within the living charge.
The bag once empty filled with fire.

I'd like to find out, just what you said.
I'd like to see you. Justice dead.
Who'd like to see you. Justice served
With lies to go around, the sentence served.

Your grips fallen.
I'm fallen, we've fallen beyond.
Expired, we've acquired platonic disease.

No jury, your cause.
Speak laws afford the bigot.
Back load myself.
Lay down the sentence of never ending said.

Platonic disease.
Platonic disease.

No jury. The pain.
The chance wronged release pain.
The stakes torn, lives cross.
Deep waters, willing loss.

Download main site.
Lay down victims right.
The fuels burnt, worlds part.
Seems like a never ending vicious cycle of death, of death.

Platonic disease.
Platonic disease.

Now see, world dies.
Strips down the face of disguise.
No rules, my way.
My way of things to say.

Your pore boils, burnt sore.
Lift off the face of wood.

Platonic disease.
Platonic disease.
Platonic disease.
Platonic disease.

Face yourself in
Burns with fortune.
Comes with the falling rain.
Peels down, racist game.

Death falls, blood pours.
Then we see lies pour, lies pour.
Come to the falling, life's near the end.
Life's end is guessing, for understand.

Feel that wetting, need to restrain.
Holding nothing, leather and string.
The killing comes first.
The killing comes first.

Letting the ending melt barren land
With that one thing can't understand.
Relive nothing waste my own time.
Accomplishing zero life passes by.

Face your fear.
Face it with blue skies, blue skies.
Living is misery, misery.

Resign my brain.
Knows bored, minds cored.
Your fate has come rewound.
I thought the day I'd die you'd rule.

Rewind my sense.
Range choice of live expense.
Days come, nights fall.
Fix all mistakes, rule all.

When is locked in.
Set back within your realm of violence.
If you see anything, soon we'll rise.

Resign, my brain.
Knows bored, minds cored.
Your fate has come, rewound.
I said the day I'd rule you'd die.

Resign my friend.
Knows bored, minds cored.
Your fate has come rewound.
I said the day I'd rule you'd die.

Spirits call, spirits rise.
Desolate sky, spirits die.

Haunting for the silence as the sickness falls within.
You've got your strays, the mice are killed.
It stems between the sick.

Spirits call, spirits rise.
Desolate sky, spirits die.

Haunting for behind them finds us meaning on the way.
The words fill, the chapters come.
It dissipates, it stays.

Spirits call, spirits rise.
Desolate skies, spirits die.

Falling hard, arriving fear.
Feeding on the weakest core.

Live face, live wars
Live final fallen shore.

Wise up down play.
Locked spine.
The spirits rule, lies down
Rip the cord, spent with the dead.

Lockdown.
Lockdown.

Life's pace. Crowds boss.
View the scum you'll cross.
We're burned in, we're burned out.
We're burned on the fire.
Relax, lie down.
Beg to a different crown.

Wise up, down play.
Locked spine.
The spirits rule, lies down
Rip the cord, spent with the dead.

Live face, live wars
Live final fallen shore.
Relax, lie down.
Beg to a different crown.
Lockdown west side
Sent to a distant land.

Wise up, down play.
Locked spine.
The spirits rule, lies down
Rip the cord, spent with the dead.

A pressure point, feel resort life.
Worthless soul, a periled stay.
Release fear, to spare, your gone.

You come with me through Satan
And through the arch of maker's side.
A pressure point.
A pressure point.
10.	Back from the Dead	05:13	  Hide lyrics
 	Fall, white light fell.
You fear, the point death sent.
Rise the dead's awake.

You, you like to find me in what's right.
Like to dream me in hell, dying.
We're back, we're back and for once more.
Like to come in To want gore.

Feel. I said rest. You're bad, forgive him.
Rising, rot the one that's lost.
Living out what's discard.
Debating over what is right.

You're feeding the guts, feeling the parts
Grinding the stone sentenced one.
Fall, white light fell.
You fear the point death sent.

Raid, raiding out the one that lost.
Living out the ones discard.
Debating over what is right.
Like to find me in what's right.

Luring me into soul-seething swoon

Murder shrieks into halls of mildness
A hissing Horror collapsing upon hindsight
Etching distorted paths into the skin of infants
As hatched moths fly out in the Night

Angelical afterbirth conceived
Within damp caverns of oneiric 
Like blooming tumors that erupt 
Bursts the rotten fruit of normality

Beyond the labia of lepers
And the squeals of boiling babes
Swells wondrous wounds of Scarlet Evil

The angels all drowned in lamenting flesh
Infinity choked beneath a human face
And the word of god is froth from putrid lips
Crucified to dull hopes and faiths

Prayers echo against temple walls
While the shriek of Aeons cracks the pillars

Mantis-faced and reeking of insane love

O Messiah that lurks between each heartbeat
The laws of clay rewritten in flames
The Key crushes the locks they crafted
As countless worlds chants your name:

The Kingdom shall come as a thief at night
To rob us off formation’s sleep
With a Light that no eyelid was made to block
Like eardrums that burst a great lengths ‘neath the sea

Exclaim the Truth that we all shun

Seven beheaded swine chants in the night
Along the stairs towards the dimmed fire fountain
A riddle of where the ruby of Lumiel fell
Lost among the stinking brothels of Sodom

And Nahas' scales gleam in gulfs of plague rats
Where I sought divine sparks in verminous bile
And my billion dead sons vibrates the mantra
To raise HE whose purity all worlds defile
Terror blazes like an obsidian iris
Atop the crooked steeple of stellar cacophony

Glistening amid the rotting heads of my rosary
Countersunwise, Hellwards an in between...

Air in veins, cracks in chains, wounds in the body of god

To estrange me, utterly derange me
To carve His name into my tongue
That I may speak Him clearly, verily
As an oracle of IRK-AL-LA
es, I was the Word that escaped me
Beneath mounts upon mounts of revolted selves
In dispersion ensnared
Yet in distance became Aware

In distance shown
The unknown became known*
In absurdism
In the shadow of Lucifer

...And as the bulging boils of Time burst open
I face uncountable dimensions merging into one
Contradictions overflowed in an all-encompassing vortex
While distance dissolves and stars burn out
Along the hand that once sought to enclose infinity
Each pore: An endlessness in an eternal Now

Unfolding into depths of points of overlapped Present
Unlocked before an all-observing Eye

Shall beget motion within an Abyss without sequence
Yet Nothing shall still be as Nothing
For Creation makes no fucking sense

Drive deep your eye into the shifting streams of Luna
Thrust your gaze through her hymen and into Death
About the scattered ruins of overcrowded phantasms
Whose writhes echo the lives that they shed

The Abyss speaks if you dare to listen
It howls when the Moon is drowned in Night
And a step from an unmarked grave is taken
And memory slips out of shape - out of sight

Death slips between sentence
Madness slips through sense
Non Sense slips into Sentience
Absence seeks senseless Self

There you shall dissect your heart
To find the room by human gods unseen
Where the will to life flows inverted
Into the great sleep of all our dreams

Throw the coin into the ancient waters
Where heads and tails are evened out
And the cogwheels rust in weary stutter
At the cenotaph of doubt
May your eyeglobes fall ever backwards
May you swallow your own tongue
Immerse the dream, dip the song, drench the kiss
In Layla's deathblack wine
Oh the wild waves that drift sublime
Out of face - out of mind
Out of reason - out of rhyme

Can you gaze any deeper?
Into the cold depths where your flaming vision once fell
Then know once for all
That it as but the Abyss that gazed into itself...

How feeble thy man hast come forth unto us.
To thine blessed land.
Provoking his crucifixion...

Thus to endure the reality of everlasting damnation...

So as said...
Thy feeble saviour...
Is to return...

Thou only suffer evermore.

Suffer!

How feeble thy man hast come forth unto Golgotha.

Rot in your burning crypts, breaking the gates of life.
Deep beneath earth's abyss.
Souls burnt to a dark crisp.
Bodies taken from the graves.
Buried under sacred dirt.
Still embalmed stiff flesh.
Skin burnt to the core...

Recite the words of the living hell.
Arise the ones from the eternal sleep.
Awaken evil ones that rest below.
Come forth and show your rotting soul...

Thriving for days of peace.
Rotting corpse another deceased.
Breaking through their sealed caskets.
Digging their way through the earth...

Summoned the witches gods.
Rigor mortis rotting creatures.
The arising of the dead...

Burning flesh the sensation.
They come forth to steal your life.
Bring forth the deceased...

Bodies taken from the graves.
Burned under sacred dirt.
Still embalmed stiff flesh.
Skin burnt to the core...

Disciples of mockery, blasphemy.

Christ will rot, suffer in pain.
Nailed unmercifully, grotesquely hung.
Gasping for air, collapsed lungs.
Stripped of vitality, suffocate...

Denied from salvation.
Destroy, the remains of Christ.
For his flesh won't rise.
Burned to ash, Christ's abolishment...

Holy apparition, seeking death to save.
Sins of the flesh, the cadaver is unfit.
Penetrate the mind and body, spirit is incarnated.
Spiritual entrapment.
Spiritual deformity...

Foolish ghost of god.
Embodied with the putrid corpse.
Trapped within the flesh.
Forever rots in misery...

Mutilate the sacred land, desecration of their gods.
Dismember their vital organs, drain the precious blood.
Conserve the rotting flesh, preserve the intestinal structure.

Endure the internal pain, screams of the vital torment.

Shred their body parts, burn the bones to ashes.
Suffer from the evil crypt, redeem the souls to hell...

Arise gods of war, demons of death.
Entrant the souls, destroy the bodies.
Kill the sacred ones, mortify them all.
Feel the pain, as the blood is drained.

Destruction from the gods below, sacrifice the lost souls.
Hell's gates now open wide, for the ones that died.
Fly angels of the night, prophecies the unholy massacre.

Demons of war and torment, arise from down below.
Guardian of the gates, deprive them of their souls.
Ignite the soul on fire, massacre the land of the weak.

Evil one enters the helpless soul, merciless, the giver takes his toll.
Reveals the evil, condemns the victim.
Corruption of the holy, destruction of gods.
He is the giver of the living torment.
Deny the blackest wrath, devour sweet suffering...

Endure the precious soul, break through sacred flesh.
Exorcist, the demons wrath, entrainment of the evil one...

They call on the beginning of burning.
Enter the maze, the realms of darkness.

Feast on flesh of newborn life.
Commencing ritual of ancient baptism.
Raise high the fetal excrements.
Bless this birth for it must be cleansed.

Into damnation, sacrificial rite of the newborn child.
Ritualistic mass forever with the god.
Rid the afterbirth of sin...

Into the dark they see, visions of immortality.
Ready to feast on corpses, awaiting the flesh of mortals...

Christening the afterbirth...

Bodies putrefied beneath.
Unholy sepulchre yet to be revealed.
Decayed beyond recognition.
Preparing the form of a black mass...

Christening the afterbirth...

Seraph let me be immortal like you.
Immaculate rot, accurse in divinity, the somber beginning of birth.
Is the eternal glory of demonic conception...

Plain of decay, sorrow and anguish, mortal's roam.

Immortal cessation, denied ascension...

Jesus...was...mortal...

Possess the soul of the weak.
Walk the gates that open wide.
For the ones that will die enter the world that waits inside...

Now deceive the cross, induce thou evil.
Hypnotize the wrath of priest.
Redeem the soul of deceased.
Confront the demons of the dark...

To enchant soul of innocence, deviate the mortal life.
Reincarnate the evil spirit, deviate the mortal life.
Unleash the blood of the goat, raise high the horns of hell.
Profanation of the gods, sacrilegious torment.
Soul has come to it's final task, demons carved your burning flesh.
Arise the ones from eternal sleep, come forth and show you rotted
soul...

Pentagram is hailed in hell.
Star of death brings infinite life.
Enter the circle and desecrate.
Devours the soul, embalm the body...

Thoughts of death are near.
Angels child lives in fear.
Taken from the holy land.
Tortured in hell forever damned...

Blasphemy - left to die.
Sodomy - the blood is raised.
Reap of evil - takes it's toll.
Profanation of the gods...

We will be pure in the abyss.
Salvation.
Reigns...

Praying for a dying religion.
The lord will bless us...
Misfortune of God.
The throne is lost.
Christ's fate.
Was a lie...

Beyond the holy grounds.
His souls are torn apart.
Reality has descended upon.
Abominations is the love of God...

Trembling diabolic possession
Of the now extracted, dreary soul.
Chaotic inhibition, eternal visions of blasphemy real.
Ancient tongues
Recite northward
Infernal praise

Image of the divine deceiver

Sacriligious dominance

Moisture of blood descending upon my essence

A trip to the mental inferno

Possession, entraps my mortal soul
Demented, hunger of anguish I crave

The feast of 2000 years,
The sin of abomination I foresee

Damned in Christ's blood, thy soul is not of he
Catholic degeneration, unholy desolation

Perversions of the trinity,

Bleed with me into the abyss
Masters of the pure hellish retaliation

Deliverance into temptation

Unheavenly skies

A twilight that will guide us to an empire...

Of forever pure tranquillity, of darkness
For true tranquillity can be found in our somber souls

Where perversions will prevail
A place of unremitting shadows
Where we savor the sadness of divinity... DIVINITY
The hour has arrived when perversions will prevail
The blood red skies will infest the heavens
The horns will guide us to paradise.
We will eternally live in so-called forsaken damnation
Indulging in the sweet hunger of temptation.

Mournful apocalypse, forbidden visions
Sacrificing the once-bastardized soul

Majesty of Infernal Damnation

The mountain apex, we hear its mournful call
A calleth of triumph, a calleth of blasphemy

Our triumphant majesty of infernal damnation
Upon infinite twilight!

Bent on bloodshed, revenge and destruction

Spurn all past allegiance
Curse and reject the law with abhorrence

Master of the darkness

Abdicating God's abode

Extinguishing salvation

In our sovereign's wake lies destruction
Loathsome savior mourns again
Our reign shall be glorious

Persecuted they gather, remnants of a coven
Converge into enchantment
Mystic storm of phantom devilry
They summon the Impious
Inciter of truth
He shall bear right against their foes
He takes charge of their souls
Into the rings of Hell
Supreme lord of unholy blasphemy
Their brothers tortured and burned
From the ashes they now return
Visages of sinister possession
Bestowed with ardent powers upon them
They seek atonement for treacherous ways
And weave their spells of dark sorcery
Filled with impetuous rage

Seraphim immersed in scorn
Perceptions decrepit, eclipses blind faith
Sagacity with misery itself entwines
And the roots of blasphemous deception stem from their minds

Indulging in temptation and sin, they were cast down
Into regions of sorrow, the deep tract of Hell

Transformed into devils, for they would not revere
Beguiled, curse their miserable fall

The liberty of Perdition
Spiritual de sanctification
Inverted redemption
Sempiternal Pandemonium

Thrown into the utter deep darkness of Chaos
Their baleful eyes cast contempt upon Heaven

Eternal light now immortal dark
Rise again hierarchy of infamy, your black wings ascend the skies

In tribute to your revenge, we proclaim ourselves to thee
Open wide the hellish portal victory, arise our darkest revenge

Storm laden skies vomit black rain, awaken the return

Satanic Minions, unlock the past
Bring forth chaos with bitter revenge
Desecration of laws at our command
Receive thy masters and mourn eternally

Forgotten glory
Visions of infernal inspiration, we are servants to the Abyss
Horde of conquerors, we dethrone the savior
We shall reign in Lustful Demise

Conjuring summoned ones with unholy recitals, ancient Spells
In Lustful Demise

Parade the lie of rotten design
Fervour from this prison of holiness
I need freedom from this death
Bathed in the solitude of righteousness
The cold grip of misery burns my soul
Corrupted in the impurity of sin

Succumbing to the excommunication
I am forever lost in the waves of rebellion

I descend into this world
The kingdom of Indulgence
A palace of provocation, anathema

Banishment becomes escape

Whom I receive my soul I enslave

Can you believe
Words of a prophet
No paradise awaits

Great misleader
This prophet
Deceiver
Summon believers
With empty rewards

Upon thy servants
Leaving no trace
Of their feeble existence

Tolerance unveiled
Frailty and weakness
Infidels deliver
Merciless vengeance

Question your god
You've lost your faith
Once man of the cloth
Now consumed by disgust

Your will was weak
Now is strong
My turn to destroy
Arise, the fallen priest

I lust for sin
I mock the church
Invert your savior
Awaiting the heaven's descent

Unleashed from hell
To spill your blood
No mercy
No remorse
My turn to destroy

For my grief, you will pay

For my pain, you will suffer
Now I see what you did for me.

Faith no more abides in me
Released from its deception
I harbor no guilt
Reborn through my transgressions

Exultant
The dawn of dissolute rule
Receive strength through iniquity

Profound judgement
Spewed forth upon the pure
The upright have faltered

Exalt who denounces this fading kingdom
Dethroned trinity, embellished divine power
Malicious transgressor to purge the holy

Unleashed to lay waste
The son of man

A messiah to endure the cross of our defiance

Fear of knowing no heaven to behold

Doctrines of reproach... 

Held high
Crucified like thieves
Suffering in agony
Burning flesh
Putrid stench
Charred in the wind

In hatred we indulge
Your cruelty we rejoice
Let it be known

A morbid martyr for all to remember

The stench of crucifixion

In hatred we indulge
Your cruelty we rejoice
Weeping for your god... your fucking god!!

Gates of hades
Realm of the dead
Multitudes will be shamed to everlasting contempt

The messiah is my servant
A serpent for my greed

Manipulation for an agenda
Mass enslavement over mankind

With diabolical fear
And fire as our weapon

Oblivious, I submit

My essence is wasted...

Consecrated debauchery
Religious hypocrisy

Wallowing in your dogma
Self-righteous bastards of Christ

It rapes the heavens from it's summit
Looming from aloft, to destroy innocence
Symbols archaic and ancient
Stones gleam on it's gates

How the flesh held taunt walls it's chambers
Foundation never splinters made of bone
Crafted throne of pestilence
By hands of spectral malevolence

Endless reign from the darkness bestowed
Binding sigils hold the fortress to soul

Festering carrion in heaps will remain
Mankind’s future forged from his domain

Black veins it's shadows cast
From a radiant sacred flame
Delved are it's bloodquenched roots

Wielder of the crooked staff advances
Vestals contort in stances

Festering flesh of the "divine" host
The means to tread the astral path
How the "godly" succumb to their wrath

Virtuous three bequest the corpse sight
Knowledge passed through this rite

In fetters the defeated enslaved
Their infinite victory

Devotees self immolate then to profane

In ironwood she's enthroned
East, beyond veiled mortality
Through lustful fornication
Mother of abominations, arise !

Bearer of the wolf :
Gorged on flesh cannot satisfy
Frothing jaws swallow the sky

Elder of the sovereign of Hel :
Slaves to her realm, all must face
Half rotten grace
Holds you in embrace

Origin to the serpent supreme :
As it coils our mortal sphere

His ancient maws will release
Their feeble race shall cease

children now dine

Exalted in ice she will decree
Her spawn now are set free !

Liquid consciousness
Congealed existence
Conceived in profound purpose

Suspended over Axis
Gouged stone gate
Carved around chalice

Useless cold instrument
Puddles the emblem below
Conjures the fiend once dormant
Through the membrane now aglow

Vibrate the word :
Arise beast of blood !

Radiate it's truth :
We beseech the fiend of rage
Devour with talon and tooth

Fierce and dense
Religious offense
Darkness howls
Viscera and bowels
Corpses as thicket
Internals exhibit
Vultures feast
Ruptured priest

Inside this shroud I remain
Behind this light my emptiness
Erase your rotten shell
Instil my oceans of death
Dawn of the everlasting
Sacrament and sacrifice

Reaper in the moonlight of waste
Yield to the sword of truth

Enter the eternal reign
Spill there blood
Feed the flesh to the soil
Impalement of divinity

The inevitable ending
Creation through darkness

How repulsive is man
When they bring no profit to humanity

Advance your allotted span
Never to illuminate your quran
Closed is your understanding
Talmudic rhetoric fading
The Bible and it's addicts
No life to contradict

We seek discipline through power
All feces of faith must cower

Slaves of belief in their frailty
Now grovel before us in fealty... die !


Each endures ones shadow
The shades of misdirection
To wide plains we are led
Till the centuries complete their millennium orb
Extracting the ingrained
Leaving those of virtue to ethereal consciousness
And the fire of clean air under mauve skies
A millennium in Elysium and eternity is nigh

Lethe (Forgetfulness)

Born from fury you mock it's purity
You are stained with innocence

The blood will not cleanse
Rooted in blood it stems

Mercury's gift isn't for the unworthy
Silt is in the veins of god's larvae

Forgotten - scrolls and scriptures was your deceit
Blotted - severed from the mind never to rejoin
Discarded - like the spawn from your loins

The nether that flows to Amphora
Grave offerings for the third epoch

Unknown to man, lust unfulfilled
An urn for life that spilled

Acheron (Sorrow)

In utter woe you lacerate your freedom
Every gouge brings you closer to Hades

Guilty - purge your undoing in life
A trial in wretched agony

Greeting your flesh with fevered delight
Envious - sculpt away the fallacy

Loss exhausts your vitality
Within this torrent devoid of mortality

Amongst brethren in harmonious mire
A deluge of sorrow merged with desire

Envious - sculpt away the fallacy
Loss exhausts your vitality
Within this torrent devoid of mortality

Styx (Hate)

Divinity trampled under foot
Revealing the path which we course

Never to swell or recede
Flowing is the purity of hate
Tributaries only deceive
Diligence to rage opens his gates

In life you weren't worth conception
Vomited from the womb
In death the Earth in repulsion
Vomits your corpse to consume

Fire

Rewarded for devotion and service
Submerged never to surface

Gasp in flames
Inhale the Inferno
No lamentation heard of sorrow

Now you are luminous as we
Says your gods as you plead

Ash lined shores clouding waves above
Radiant limbs flail
As Gods exhibits his love

Lamentation

This tide heaves and sighs
A fountain from sorrow brings cries

Snivelling servants
Slaves of attrition

Mourners wade this descent
Wails of hope are fervent
Silent is the dirge of torment

Your god's promises echo in vain
Your lamentation carries in this domain

Devoted I hold the dagger
carve the will
darkened forces, revel (in) rapture
portals flung wide

Behind this altar,
forgotten pantheons

Ride winds of ethereal incantations
flame and moonlit rite ravages
Harkened soundscapes open
Passages

Now a tyrant unleashing unholy
obliteration

Vortex churning blackness
approach into being

Their breath is repulsion
earthing abominations

Unseen eyes watch
closer I become one
I follow them down
riding the winds of the forgotten

The phantom in your heart
I am the hidden wisdom
The unconscious universe
Frozen in darkness

Lead me to this place where the dead
cry and sing
In the image of the beast I roam

Devoured by the earth and all it's
vengeance
Inside this mortal frame
I ascend in the eternal

Appease the wraith of the dead
I walk among the lifeless

So few stands in the hour glass
slipping so fast away

I ascend in the eternal

Sanguine, the father
on riches and power, masked dissent

Murdered
A retort of treason, endorsed
dominion

Whores - exile and butcher

Conspiracy
Their god's words shall never
transcend

Usurper
Enforcer reap children for slaughter

Bastards
Execute and torture

A feeble attempt to perpetuate
All ways overthrown by imperial
Freedom

Progeny of tyranny

At the end worm ridden putrefaction
laced his face

With no intervention of salvation
by his god's holy grace

Hordes of nomadic tribes
Heathen pantheons crushed
Infestation of monotheism

Transcend into absolute dissolution

Halts progression
once superior
now symbolizing
the deplorable

For ineffectual mortals
decrepit intellect
Lost in destitute
spirituality

Four crumbling walls symbolizing
nihility
gateways to disillusion
realm of ignorance
we shall defy
Die!!!

Nails impacted, the chains are retracted
A moment of agony in lack of power
every nerve will twitch in pain
till your unable to feel you're insane

Liquid flames gnash their searing teeth
shearing the tissue from your form
joints rupture and ligaments breach
the fleshy confines of humanity
weak!!!

Hair incinerated, eyes liquidated
teeth crushed by powder
under this strain, when all life cower

The mind succumbs to oblivion!

A charred and hollow silhouette
as the entrails fall loosely from your body
shrouded ones approach this
cadaverous art
sitting through your remains to
foresee after you depart

Christians flock, judgement

Thousands perished
on the block

Axes fall on necks
call forth vengeance at Verdun
scorn heaven

Heathen arbitration!
Christian castration!
Vengeful retribution!
Holy dissolution!


Eulogy in stone, that now stands alone
let no filth, infect your lands

Cower, die, in defeat

Tyrannous fanatical indoctrination
circumvents sanity
mass genocide

Profound loathing

Vengeance unleashed
shedding their blood
screams on deaf ears
mass genocide

Profound loathing

Immolated
Strangled
Branded

Inhuman atrocities
Militant fanaticism

A homeland lost
A terroristic holocaust

Profound loathing

Spawned from the vortex of death
Your microcosm that flows
In frozen veins, mirrors

Yet immortal, with pride and faith
Night skies and blackened domains
We advance as a legion unbound
all fear and remorse are drowned

Every warrior joins their echelon

By chant
By conjuration
By dagger

Create the scales of this celestial hydra

Whispered dream speech that
consumes

By chant
By conjuration
By dagger

We're at one with the beast
and we must feed

Indulged insanity
Inexorable
Spawned from sorrow
Infliction of naivete

From hollow sands
advocation on lies, reign eternally
From hollow sands

Indulged insanity, inexorable
Spawned from sorrow
Infliction of naivete

Dogma is reinforced
consuming indoctrination, to weaken
control their minds

From hollow sands
advocation of lies, reigns eternally
from hollow sands

We are your disease
engulfed in iniquity
your indoctrinated soul
let the degradation consume you

we defy your broken prophet
and decrepit god!!!!

Ludi Saecularis
receive our sacrifices

Altar of Blood
neptune's blood

Son of Saturn
Centennial pattern

Bowels of earth churn
Dis pater's return

Sulfuric Legion
ash coats the sun

In Darkness cremate
Pyroclastic fate

By breath of Neptune
The boiling ocean consume

Man and beast
Fuel the pyre
broken by fire

Commands of the mind must be
Unnumbered spirits will see

Each holds sway over thee
The vessel only yearns to see

But we plant the very seed
Which guides to deceive

No banishment can cure
The muse's nature so pure

Behind his eyes they know
Your attempts to deny show

Ecstasy in every life you take
Driven by our ethereal hate

Again ... Consume the ignorant
Regret ... Speeds your descent

Rebirth through your shell
No longer a denizen of hell

Voracious upsurge
A swarm from Mecca converge
Millions in gregarization
Infectious degradation

Howling in stridulation
Prayers insight infibulation
Moulting their humanity
Under burqas lies barbarity

Desert prophet's creations of clay
Infidels suffer their plague
Iridescent wings flutter
Technology torn asunder

Gestate the wasps of Iblis
Fire-born from the abyss

Pride for the father of Djinns
(Decapitate) their souls from within

I reside within, under fathomless silence
Event horizon of gathered darkness
Their daggers, slice through thought, subconscious
This chamber, I'm confined, cerebral
Secretion cloaked interior, where life is inferior

Luminous races palms, scorn the sky
Homage to those who never die
Subconscious ripped wide under spell

Unborn larvae, now in hand, rose and fell
Consumed through, emotionless maws
Cilium flow, coursing......... enthralled
Clenching their, serpentine dance
Heaved from me, in trance

Born-less reincarnation
Deathless transmigration

Now you are beckoned through this veil
Shared suffering through the lidless eye I hail

Flame's adoration deep underfoot
Staves of the Volur crusted in soot
Bones that mutter their legacy
Obscure barrow smite the heavenly

Conscript of ancient ways despite their demise
Crystal eyes, hold despise, in hundreds that arise

Virility and rage, from the stone and iron age
Earthen bell, burial cage, in blood they assuage

Restless warriors upsurge, war drums pace their trudge
Wretched soil drinks the carnage

Resurrection tolls, god has no control
Deathless and divine Gododdin soul
(This) foul bishop who defiled at Glen
Feel the rage of heathens return once again

The great hall echoes our revelry through time
Shadow of the great goat's horns so sublime

Gefrin is alive, the old gods forever thrive
Lavish in death from the Henge to their hive
Birthright reborn, a legacy restored
Death to your flock, by Gefrin's ancient horde

Desire for what was
Scars are all that howl the pain

Rage, replace, my bereavement

Through the flesh, I shift between the night world and void

Imprisoned with us, you now understand our plight
To savor suffering, (and) turn from light

Cloaked in a veneer of death
The defeated's putrescence
Drawn in every breath

The third month approaches
The red smoking mirror encroaches

Twenty dawns arise!
By bone wand baptize

Through a decaying face
Gaze into a living god’s eyes

Twenty suns set!
Shed the mantle with no lament

Your flesh gives us power
Our enemies failure, (their) final regret

Godly existence behind decay
The night drinker

Soil that surrounds
Fester underground
Tombs so profound
Shrouds fall unbound

Reduced to dust
Epitaphs carved
Overgrowth barbed

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't

My work is to dispose
But never bury those
Faithful decompose
I will appose

Bloodline died
Generations piled
Side by side

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't

Take your divinity (elsewhere)
Silent (in your) empty stare
Wasteful life the holy lied
For I interred when you died

I won't cremate
Vermin permeate
Apostate

To live with filth by choice we don't
To die with filth by right we won't

Time did not exist nor the human flaw
Poisonous beasts and your vanity
Only virtue of interest is dependency

My scorn forces submission to fate
Domestic or savage feel my hate
Crowned bovine
Shackled swine
Equal in ash, mortal trash

I am your Messiah, I am the world’s cure
Hunting the earthly cattle, unholy savior

Dreamt into existence by theologian strife
Collapse to dust for the foul usury of life

Bestiaries of humanity
Guardian of rage binds you to shame

I was your Messiah, at last I cured this world
Hunted the earthly cattle, destiny unfurled


Feast for the lions of Venus
Shallows hold dead offerings
Crimson descends on harpy wings

Bespattered blood, on black stone

Savaged the sentry has fallen
Sated beast had left him rotten
Stones shower as it was foretold
Visions from the basin of gold

Branched tongue, Juno is ablaze
Raptures fire, in Jupiter’s gaze

Satyr hooves pound with delight
Foul seed drowns in fright
These omens, lead to its return
Now your god, will forever...burn


Abode of breathless, ancient lord
Realm beneath, unexplored
Fall....

Engulfing void, her madness is might
Blood creator saves, us from finite
Guide our path....

Lead with tablets of destiny
Forge ahead, in wondrous cruelty
Miscreation erodes
Now vomit the inferno....

Scales glimmer, wings bellow
Delirium, fury, overthrow

Mid absu, and earth
Tiamat’s glory, prophesized
Sanctified....

Old ones, awake arise
Kingu's behest, agonized

War cry, thunderous
Prophet, flock, purified

Assuming posture of Shavasana
Through a narrow gateway of infinity
A thousand eyes of Vairocana
Shall watch my ascent
Transfigured stars rest in each nexus
Sacred letters surround walls

Face of the faceless ones
Form of the formless one

The everlasting wheel is unveiled
Eternity's voyage is unleashed
A once ordained passage
The entrance of oblivion
Where inanimate convalesce
A thousand eyes watch the ascent

Face of the faceless ones
Form of the formless one

Rest the Gods with no centre
All pervasive bearers of the third eye
Beckon me to join the ranks of the dead

The light of Mahakala
Call of the faceless one
The force of omnipotence
The light of Mahakala

Return to the corpse
Sounds pierce
The lower waters of purification
The levitation is complete
We must die - be born anew
Hear this utterance - one of rebirth

Beckoning me to join the ranks of the dead
I can see the light of Mahakala
I am drawn nearer, nearer

The light of Mahakala
Call of the faceless one
The force of omnipotence
The light of Mahakala

The light of death

Etched by the hands of idolators
Carved by winds, there stands an efface
A grotesque hue from aeons past
Aligned on eroded walls of negation

Resemblance to valley is olfactory
Where deities crumbled and shattered
By afflicted feet, on sands of polarities
The ruminant paths crossed by many

Assimilate and devour
Form a chasm
Where there lies
A crypt of abstract immortality
Disembodied spirits dwell inside

By Moloch's hand
Pass through flames
To the Beyond
From womb of initiation
Black ash of the offerings
Red image, flaxen stone

Grant depth and light
Assimilate, devour

He is the purifier
He, the one who is just
He, the abominable shrine
He is the bearer of the eye of ascension

Protector of wanton rites
Destroyer, of processions that pass
Guarantor of passage
Sanctifier - Ashtar-Kemosh

Guardian of the embalmed
A primal dawn shall rise
Over the one, ascetic eye

With raised arms, flanked by two seals
That control tides

Overseer of thirteen gates of wisdom
Hollows of devotion and transfiguration
Blessed by the lord of corruption
Assimilate and devour
Form a chasm
Where there lie
Burial Chambers

Disintegrate my anatomy with divine breath
Initiate within an endless hall
I am there

Mystic light of the dead
Lead us towards dissolution
Hidden chant of a voice
For your utterance bears no source

For it's brighter than a thousand stars
Flowing from the pores of luminosity
Carried by the flight of transference
Adorn with ecstatic reveries

The Yacquis term it dreaming
For Tibetans, the stages of Bardo
Therein lies the portal
Of our altered existence
For emisseral projections
Emisseral projections

I am detached from the body
I am no longer but flesh
Suspended in the hanging dimension
Vitality beyond comprehension
Projections further, further beyond the void
Penetrated nature behind visions

Paradoxical existence less physical form
Abandonment of the flesh
Elevates realms of turbulent illumination
Commit the shell to fade

Sacrament of the expanse
Of shadows and rays
Omniscient radiance heeds the light of the end

Awakening from the slumber of mortality
To dissonances of the intermediate state
Surrender to magnitude of impermanence
Hark the exaltation of loss

Freedom from the world of matter
Alienation from the past
Euphoria turning to anguish
Sorrow eclipse elation

Inhale the rotten stench

In the mouth of perpetual light
Claustrophobic fumes of spiritual degradation
Mists darken
Towards the joyless plane
I transmigrate

He speaks through the moon that he may be renewed
A wondrous crown for those who were born from me
An altar of earth thou shalt make
Exiled flesh restores the composite mass
The sacred marriage, a visceral attraction
To enriched earth, the offerings from blessed death

I take my place in the charnel grounds
A witness to the molecular rites of Shiva

Inheritance of this image of infinity
Limitless dormancy
The timeless realm of a gaping abyss
Repatriation to Mother Death
Open mouths chant the fervent hymn

Open the quarters of the city of silence

Glyphs adorn grey tombs
Protect the conception
Womb of palingenesis
Configured in soil
Sanctified by the winds
Moss and secretion
The reverent feastings
Odoratus sepulcrorum

To enriched earth
The offerings from blessed death
Open mouths chant the fervent hymn
Rejoice! O putrefaction, the divine breath

Limitless sense of doom
Reincarnates with undulating pulsations of gnosis
Pierced with tongues of fiery revelation
The breath separates layers of life's narrow gate

Unfettered from earthly bounds
The veil of Eleusinian mystery is lifted
This is the night of nights, where worlds collide
And where incense shall rise
Expose us to the cosmic winds
Incandescent suns will surface
In the hearts of our void's emanation

The flesh is surrendered in
Without skin, beyond marrow and bone
Renounced will
The laws of another devour
The flesh is surrendered in
The laws of another devour

Unravelled, the essence is clear
Affirmation of lore turned spirit
Unravelled, the essence is clear

Renounced will
The laws of another devour

The serpent shall straighten down the middle pillar
The spine shall coil through the second layer
The serpent shall straighten down the middle pillar
The spine shall coil through the second layer

Shells of skin unravel to the abode of
I have strayed into the all prevailing waters
Deeper than deep, where the rule of foreign gods is manifold
And primordial formations divided the laws of our re-birth
Unravelled in seven coils

Raise a voice within
Forfeit to Adya
My body is a vessel to speak through
They comprise of seven coils
The found reflection

Machinations lay bare

The revelation is opaque
Through none shall dissipate
From chaos spawns belief

Defy laws of decay
Reversed passage, remain tellurian
Holy rites of preservation

The flesh has left the body
Initiated in the grand ossuary
To renew in greater majesty

For a soul is to redeem
Unchained for memento mori

Initiated in the grand ossuary

Spared by the worms of fate
denied, no return to dust

Robes of piety adorn
Venerated morbidity, blaspheme the redeemer
With human remains

Close the gates of time

Three nights will suffice
At the altar of soul-sacrifice
A hidden fire burns
Reflecting infinite worlds
Where the answer revolves
In union complete
Which Loka will return
To see the rebirth
Words transmute
To alchemical form
We are elevated beyond
Eleven mortal gates

Banish now! Banish now!
Thoughts of unending return
Reason is detached from the yonder
Our shackles are borne to this earth

Messenger of light
Exalt the virtues of the deceased
Uphold beliefs

Negation heeds no reward
The universe is death manifest
The sage shall urge
Submission to this state

Heed the sacred words of Yama
Transform to afterlife

No return
I shall fulfill my prophecy
I call to the depths
The depths shall call for me
To the light I'll forever fade
Unborn I shall forever be

Blessed are the words spoken
In this eternal night
Blessed are the lost embers
Of the sacred fire's light
Condensed
Is the revelation's meaning in truth
For essence evolves all
So shall it be known that "I" will evolve

Glory is beheld to the chosen Of Atman

Journey into the unknown
In the grip of afterlife

Banish now!

Three nights will suffice
At the altar of soul-sacrifice
A hidden fire burns
Reflecting infinite worlds
Where the answer revolves
In union complete
Which Loka will return
To see the rebirth
Words transmute
To alchemical form
We are elevated beyond
Eleven mortal gates

None shall recoil to see the return
We will not wonder from death to death

Pythian vapours emit from the cavern
Effluvial wisdom oracular fissure
All that is immersed
At the naval of the earth
At the side of Mount Parnassus

Prophetess and mediums of serpents
Always congregated to decipher
With rigid bodies and bright fixations
Utterances in tongues
Fumes of exaltation
Preside over the ground

Graveside rites
And reversed burial tonight
Vigils to the eye of Prajna
Revived souls' flight

Ancient sacraments
Arouse the communion
In wake of the living apparition

The stone of tombs, my laurel branches
Tabernacle stone, over the resting bones
The farthest star radiates brighter
Traces of the firmament made clearer

Sanguinary voices raise foreboding
I have trespassed the realm of the undead
I have lain in forbidden citadels

With warnings, not prophesies
Utterance of the foulest spirit

Pythian vapours emit from the cavern
Fumes exude through orifices of man
We shall known the bodies are but vessels
Of oracles channelled by unearthly hands

A bone protrudes through the earth
No longer caressed by the worm
Sanguinary voices raise foreboding
I have trespassed the realm of the undead
I have lain in forbidden citadels

With warnings, not prophesies
Utterance of the foulest spirit

Emetic ways
Ratri falls
As Kalaratri dawns

Purgative rites
The hidden truth
Avidya cast aside
On this seventh night

Purgative circumvolution
The once written
Once told prophecy
We devour our own flesh
As the serpent meets the head
Shedding skin in adoration of sin
I shall become

Purgative circumvolution
Our mantra, our just reward
The head and the yes that stare
To the crescent moon of Shiva
We shall crawl

Copulate to defile
Yield no heart towards desire
Cast perception into the fire
Shiva does not end in Shakti

Feast on the breasts of Kali
This is the rite of Shiva

At one with the way I have become
To exert is not to suffer
Follow the voice of fleeting images
Where foundations are sightless winds
The black pearl grows unabated
Seen only by those initiated
The visions of the grand mother

Emetic ways
Ratri falls
As Kalaratri dawns

Pearls of wisdom adorn
Our chain of searching
Will transforms to a black stone
Heralded by the great yearning
From an origin of time unknown
This is the pilgrimage of wandering
The temples are of sand not stone

To the crescent moon of Shiva I crawl
Crawl to the crescent moon of Shiva

Gathering, summoning of ancient ones
From ancient times
To offer a sacrifice
Into mystic climes
A corpse arose, unburied

For centuries lost
In glorification of the impure
The corpse arose
In the blessed name of Shiva

The corpse is rising
Revealing death's curse
Which reigns supreme
Manifesting all which that is holy
Impurity

Doctrines I invoke
Upheavals I practice
Sermonising invocations
This is the aura of my existence
I glorify His name
I glorify the ancient ways

Evoking ancient beliefs

Verily the dusk will approach
The one which revels with a shapeless scythe
Oft the waves of truth will lead me to bind
The hands of faith under the cloak of unrest
To sleep beneath elemental slumber
A gleam of surrender will unfurl

Nearing nocturnal isolation
Chants of winds and of silent streams
Dissolve the unending meridian
Climes and steppes coalesce
As the sentinel abides
Towards the crepuscular dawn
Begotten from his mind
The moon; and from his eye
The sun had birth

Wearily observing the lunation
Inviolably casting allegiance
To sidereal projections

Rest shall not overtake
The pilgrimage to the unholy grave
Towards the crepuscular dawn

Return the source, the veil of night
Implore the return of the old gods
Full moon dawn, the womb of night

Mounds, languid, converge with the ether
Transfigured branches hang
Testimony to ones which stood
And cast over the air
Peace rests nevermore

Self-abandonment is involuntary
To relinquish a human sense
To permeate into infinite earth
Contemplating the frozen veins
Of rejuvenation
Under the ruminant oaks
Where sages once lay
To claim their renaissance

Boundless river shine
One last surge before the dawn
Tides ever flowing
Under the incandescence of the sun

Return the source, the veil of night
Implore the return of the old gods
Full moon dawn, the womb of night

Return to the source
The veil of night

Embrace the full moon dawn

Verily the dawn shall awaken us
Engulfing, rapturous nocturnal isolation
Open the unending meridian
Separated by this frozen hour
As the sentinel abates
Under the full moon dawn
I shall be free

Under the full moon I stand
Beneath the empress of man

Beneath the darkened gaze
Spawn of a black, sunless dawn.
There lies a place of darkened Worship
Under the Abyssic clouds

Centuries of depravity and decay
the thickest, mystifying fog
Signifying the mass to which I adhere
Where we are gathered to summon for Satanas

Sacrifices preside
Under the gaze of the moon
The demise of the sun
Marks the Rites to which we are reborn

Ancient Sumerian curse,
Wait the ground of this temple site
Weltering and surrounded
Wolves gather to howl
Nocturnal ruins preside

Ethereal invocations in the glare of candlelight
This is the place where the winds are embraced
Here it is where I am at one
This is the place where the crypts
Call my name

Gather,
In this ritual lair
practice of which is spoken
In this ritual lair
Dungeon, ritual lair.

Practitioner of the black mass
Summoner of the bestowed power
Fallen soul leading to escape
Emancipation through a darkened void
Subtle whisper echoing in the deep
Inviting entrance into an eternal mystery

Proclaiming "satani"
Cloaked in a robe
Delving into the embrace
He is the apostle
The chosen blackened assailant

Under darkness' cover
Servitor of a lurching force
A force ignited by the black winds
Beneath the sarcophagus, rise
Shadows loom, revealing forms
Unholy initiation can begin

Black mass priest
profaner of tombs
command the procession
instruct the order of the knell

rites of darkness
ancient entity
drape the surroundings
castigate light

oh, satanas, propagator of astral light
chant the bahimirionic bestial curse
engage me in this ancient ceremonial lure.

In dedication to unearthly waters
Burning red ashen yellow
Cascade over adorned atavism

In deepest slumber realms will be reached
Reading a secret frozen in vales beyond
Channelling separate kingdoms

Worthy of the whitest crown

Veils of phospherate matter arise
Uncovering corpse remains
Pointing in four orientations
Serpentine aperes of the flame

Phospherate rays, alight the depraved passageway
Gleaming in spiritual disease

Resting in the depths of their creation
Portal to the outer world of gods
The womb of earth is open

Flowing in a current of eternal putrefaction
Filling every conclave

Currents
Oscillate
Without end

Essences will awaken called forth from the astral plane
Doxological liturgies deeply dispersed
Thus cloaked, the source of primordial matter
Unleashed from the negative seventh state

Forgotten Anu's realms
Arisen the Kuklos Anagkes
Coiled by tenebrous serpents
Met by diabolical proclamations

Creative forces through chaos
In distant domain
Distinct manifestations
Oscillate without end

They traverse through the black seas of infinity
Apocryphal shades in a voidful realm
Enduring in metaphysical suspension
Enclosed within the Noumenon

Thanatos presides over
Inhale the unknown airs of majesty
As a benighted, nameless aura
The putrid stench of Charos
Is cast over a temple grave

A triune morphosis relates
Matter and spirit to opposite
The Noumenon is embodied by
The alpha and omega of manifestation
Permeating with predatory spiritual currents

State of oneness
Flowed ascension downwards

A physical domain
An abstruse reflection

Delve into Sh'eol

Transcendental seances reawaken spirits
Unbound by space and time
Infinite in their realms
Beneath the larvae of ages
Sorcery guides their passage
To unlock the sepulchre
To manifest within the eyes of the spectre

There lie the mysteries of Kadingir
Dimensions prevalent are mystical
As mind and will embrace
Death and entities meet
Boundless forgotten spheres

I am at one with the throne

Death feasts upon channels of existence
Embodied by elemental laws
Fire devours through terror
Water carries endlessly
Flowing to streams beyond
Air holds the miasma of ancients

All of which anoint my passageway
Unto manifestations of the beyond
They are radiant in splendour,
Mighty in their voices' call

Consecrate the final separation
Through the inhaling of incense
I traverse the planes of malignancy
Unbound by space and time
Infinite in their realms

Reaching the meeting,
Between the Abyssic eyes and death

The pestilential Anubis call
Incarnated through mystic cries
They inhibit my subconscious
Their cries, they ring a dirge
As the seal is unlocked
Cast is an unearthly separation
Within the Kussa'u Tibtihu
A temple of ancient allures

Eternal is this night
As crepuscule aeons unfold
Set adrift upon an ocean
Of swarming, fathomless darkness

The lugubrious stillness seems alive
Wit the clawing of unformed shadows
The silence arises to deafen
With mute screams of buried shades

Drift into the sphere,
(All is but) a reflection in cracked eyes
Leave behind the light as
Painlessly, the flesh erodes

Traverse infinity's winds, transcend beyond
The darkness of purgatory and the cold light
Of a dying sun
The ocean now frozen, behold! Kaamos eternal!

In natures' death throes, the sun's final canticle
Collapse to disharmony and into utter nothingness

Through veils of mist
And a miasma of death
In trance-like reality
The morbid visage reveals...

Entranced, the contemptible masses
By the gaze of a violated whore
In reverence of spiritual death
They are damned in veneration

Blinded by the radiance of a black light halo
And adorned in ensanguined whites
They bend in obeisance to
The mother of abomination

All shall fall before them
In rituals of consuming
Rotting flesh and of
Black blood consecration

The gallows temples are alive
With the twitching of living corpses
In blind servitude they grovel
At the knees of their executioners

Labyrinthine passages of consciousness
A journey through euphoric heights and abyssic lows,
Swarming surge of Chaotic forces,
At odds, yet inseparable.

Light's illusion dissolves under the eclipse of the black sun.

Choronzon!
To abandon yesterday's self,
And explore the limitless horizon:
Choronzon!

Drawn like insect to flame,
The gaze of The Dying beckons us,
To stare into infinity.

From desolation of the Nightshade,
Come, mentors of sinister truth.

It is revealed: the anguishes of the past are keys,
To gates of divinity.

The 'I' shall shatter under the gravity of nothingness.
Surrendered, to indifference eternal
Sinew and Flesh cast to fire,
Foundations crumble to the four winds.

Break the waters holding thee
Waters conceived and created through sin
Born anew of air, earth and spiritual fire

Oh cosmic demurge, foul creation
Through the pulsating sphincter of spirit made flesh
Look mercifully on this child
Dry him with the breath of troublesome life

Be degenerate, dead again of water
Sanctified, the washing away of mystic life

The aid of all those weak
The crutch of all that flee to thee to suckle
The death of spirits that believe
Damnation of the dead in the realm of flesh

The shepherd's bell tolls the lambs
Take, eat, this is my spirit, which is broken for you
Drink, this is my lifeblood, which I am drained of for you

As the fires burn, noxious fumes arise...
The blistering of flesh and asphyxiation
Are the edict of this shrine to agony
Where blackened beyond recall, I reside
As one with vermin and leprous corpses

The sacramental infliction of wound upon wound
Agony divine - through flagellation purified
Arisen and reborn in profanation.

Through flesh and sinew I carved out the adoration of gods...

Vermin abode, repugnance personified
Blaspheme the holiest of temples
I held communion with corpses
And in repulsion ascend

Beyond this shrine of madness, there lies revelation...

Drown in that which lies amidst the graves,
Deep within ancient soil
And which slithers in dark cascades
Throughout the earth

Terrestrial temples reverberate
With primordial echoes whispering my name...

Embrace and envelope,
Enraptured by the burning veil
Consume and immure,
Evolve into dissolution

These tombs are sacrosanct,
Gates to transcend beyond Morpheus realms
Where revelations await

Death prevails over life
I leave my earthly remains behind
And through the Earth's cervix, I emerge

Relinquished, all attachment to the burning husks
I rejoice in death-like bliss...

In lucid slumber,
Dimensions of time and space melting simultaneously,
Memories of yesterday's merge
Into sub realms of mind

It's turbulent waters drag the 'I' to abyssic depths,
Chaos currents drown cries for control.

With outside side vision,
Innumerable eyes witness the death of 'I'
Movements, imprints, limbs, trails...
Being bursts into,
Kaleidoscopic psychosis

With each gesture,
Wading through mud and dirt
Hallucinations: from terror to nothingness
Memories: from joy to abject sorrow

Negative trip to the bowels of anxiety,
The shadow self obscures ego,
Crushed by a force of unseen might
Victory to the tyrants of the night

As the waking world beckons me with it's light,
Chains of surreality chastise will,
In the rays of hope,
The black sun eclipse, obscures the self I once knew.

A dark spirit looms amongst wretched pulpits
Old, forgotten, woeful and decayed
Wandering the ruined sacellum
Searching, seeking for scraps to sustain

Vestments once gilded, now threadbare
Relics, once gleaming, their lustre dulled
Dissolved in the aqua regia
Stained glass panes shattered

Malign spirit, thou speakest of the serpentine
Worshipped and adored by this wretched cult
Dwindling as they consume your poisonous sacrament
The weak, the tried, the sick, the lame, the faded

Beneath the vaulted, vaunted roof
Rotten wood pillars devoured by worn
Crumbling pages of mildewed tomes
Dissolved by lepers' acrid drool

Anointed in the blood and enshrined in thorns
Consume from the chalice of abomination
A feast of dry blood and dead flesh
Abhorrent are their rites of exaltation

Hands clasped, on bended knees
Eyes lowered in deference
"I am His servant, Him made flesh
You, unworthy, bow, submit"

In this slaughterhouse of love
Barren words stick in their throats
As dry bread with no wine
Hope displaced by impotence

Heed not the words of the craven
To centuries of decay lie the spires
No arcadia beyond the veil
Revel in the spheres of absurdity
For true Elysium lies within...

Chanting incantations to the void
Open to me, the abyss
of dark thunderous depths
Where tenebrous forms dwell

The aura of death permeates
as on Morpheus' wings I descend

Departing flesh-like temples,
to drift into the netherworlds

Trough gates to infinite tenebrosity
to Cimmerian kingdoms,
cast down into torment

Engulfed by desolation
In godless commune adrift
In this habitat of void and darkness,
where shadows breathe the essence of death
I dwell in affliction as reality crumbles

In eternal damnation
(I am) forever abandoned to darkened realms

Into eternal pain
Aeturnus Cruciamentum

Cursed in rapture,
on bended knee, with empty eyes
and empty hearts,
bound in exaltation

The weak willed
dwell in decrepitude,
In empty kingdoms where
thrones turned to rust

Demigod, of a sovereignty diminished
No longer shall your tyranny prevail

Arisen from ruin
falling ashes obscure the white light,
As we ascend
to dwell in glorious depravity

Beneath the darkened azure,
lie places of blackest sin
Unsanctified they lay,
in abhorrent obscurity
Buried by the sands of time
their secrets concealed

Embellished with human debris,
a collection of the macabre
Built of rotten flesh and bone,
abominable constructs...

Black masses gather,
ungodly convocations
Chants of doom resound,
evocations of ancient evil

Veins have been opened and blood,
like rivers flow from sepulchral altars
of evil worship

Spawn of the dark, arisen
through the vast centuries

Temples — Raised unto the skies
Temples — Ancient secrets revealed
Temples — Tower as sceptres of doom

Pour water on thyself
Thus shalt thou be
A creator of the sun
Charon will inhibit his entrance
The fields and dwellings of relapsing ruins
Find thou thyself in every star
Achieve thou every possibility
Listen! Heed not the siren-voice of thought
Deliver me athwart the earth
Forsaken loam of wondrous slumbers
Thee spiritual and thee fertile
A spawn of full equilibrium
But whose availeth is in this,
For hereby there comenth impair

There was not a formal sepulchre
Not one sector for the interment
Throth with thee empire of hope
All effects are welcome to Styx

Servants of death, enchanter of pain
From the land of no return, you'll kill again
Smear the blood on naked corpse
Manson.

Lunatic of God's creation
No resist
Hear the voices of devastation

There is darkness in his eyes
And you won't see it, before you die
Feel the knife of the Lord Divine's
Creation.

Satanized, crucified, feel the wrath of suicide
Incus fear of the sphere, angel darkness disappears
Covenant, blasphemous, open up unholiness
Father Satan, let me just unholy sins

Suicide sacrifice
Destruction of holy life
Blood of unholy knife
Satan I sacrifice

Behold the crucifix, symbol of sterility
I am crucifix - Satan
Suicide sacrifice, profeasting evil night
Lust into reality - Satan
Angel of the black abyss, Satan lord I hail
Insane blasphemous - Satan
Sacrificial suicide, Ritual to end my life
Behemoth infest my fate - Satan

Dammed to hell, end of my life
Wrath of God - Satan
Sin my soul, blesses with fire
Throne of stone - Satan
I must die, in my wake
Seventh gate - Satan
Suicide, end my life
I must die - Satan

Suicide sacrifice, thrust of evil deep inside
Lucifer never lies, take away thee mortal life
Demigod, Satan son, commend the body to the ground
Father Satan, I'll find peace when I am God

Evil night of an evil death
Epitome of illusion
Sacrifice of the unborn child
Enter the kingdom of darkness
Sodomized for the ritual
For there is nowhere to run
Open the gates to the manifestation
And grant me the powers of darkness

Infernal majesty, take this dead offering
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me

Exorcise the power of dead
Invert my cross of time
The realm of Satan anarchy
Inside my scared sign

Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths
Abbadon kill until nothing is left
Celtic god of a Satan fate
Oblivious to evil

Death of defiled the rituals
Of dreams and disillusion
Unlock the box and gimp in pain
Summon the demons of darkness
Evil Gods that fast with flesh
Prepare me for the dead
Release me from the angels so righteous
For your God is dead

Book of the dead, pages bound in human flesh
Feasting the beast, from the blood the words were said
I am unseen, dreamt the sacred passage aloud
Trapped in a dream of the necronomicon

Seven lords of an evil and fatal force
Levitate through the secret and ancient doors
Unbegun, premenating bizarre
Swept away to the castle of Cantar

Seeking the tomb, tried to possess
Immortal sleep, visions of death
Drank of the blood, water of life
Splendorous son, show me the sign
You are dead
Blanketing fear, unknown to man
Demons appear, death they command

Blasphermate me

We are what wars, and shall rule again
Dead by dawn, chanting death thee ancient hymm
This is not real, I am not the chosen one
Trapped in a spell of necronomicon

Tortured pain, in the palace of dead
Rec(i?)tate, through the passages I dreamt
Dead, dead by dawn
Dead, dead by dawn
5.	Blaspherereion	04:13	  Hide lyrics
 	Bleeding death, undead, broke the seal Suhrim
Desecrate, evil ghost Thoth freed him
Mass destruction, ended lives, blasphemation, you will die

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die - It's been written

Die - BLASPHEREREION
Die - BLASPHEREREION

Vicious warth Adar, torted past rendered
Odious evil, elder death, feast us
God's construction, holy doom
Don't believe, you're consumed

Lord chaos, death, save us
Kill human kind, life was denied
Lord black death, Thoth , confess
Send to desecrate, lord blasphemate

No lord shall stand before myself

I can strike the light and see through the truth
For I'm the Deicide, Dominus, what could you do
Thou has failed you now, one again and always will
On the cross, forgotten son, a sacrifice it had to be done

Died for me, well that's too bad I don't believe
Killed my sins of the evil what I am
Your destruction, reasons of a world in pain
Blind desciple, you will never live again

Wage of death, course of life
Unsematic birth of the Deicide
Eyes of pain, pleads of death
As you're put to rest

Three days to rise
If he lives again he is sure to die
I killed Jesus
Just to see him bleed on his pulpis throne
I am evil
I'm the Deicide and I killed the lord
No more reasons
I will kill the world in another form

I rule this world

NAIL HIM

I can strike the light and see through the truth
For I'm the Deicide, Dominus, what could you do
Thou has failed you now, one again and always will
On the cross, forgotten son, a sacrifice it had to be done

Sacramental ceremony
People's temple of the holy
Sepulcher for salvation

Abortion of angels that flee for their lives
Animated onslaught, expectorated discharge
Elegy of evil, visions of light for thou has forgotten

Adulating scripture, dominate, terminate

Haunted by the righteous one, bent of my repention
Crucifixion Lucifer, save me from destruction
Holy priest that can't confirm, shun the cross of evil
Violent but undisturbed, wait for thee inversion

Crucifixation - Thee unholy denominations
Crucifixation - Holy termination

You will give praise to Satan

Impaled vibration, Crucifixation

Levitating act of death, messenger of Satan's mass
Blinded by the crucifix, sacrilegious impalement

Everlasting hell damnation, from the lord, Crucifixation

Where's my crucifix?
I can't die without it.

Shunned from the light
Born into darkness never knowing
Infant enshrined
Spawn of the altar, crush mankind

Never will they see you lurking in my shadow
Unbenign the hands of god

Out of my mind into a world between
In search of the ancient artistry
Lord Kur, before your sword I see
The house of death is opening
Hanging from their primal sleep
Forbidden to be seen
Spirit of the elder gods
Are dead but must live on
Still to life and yet they breathe
Dead but dreaming...

Lords of the world within the space between
Wandering receivers of a sacrifice
Lord Kur, beyond your throne you sleep
Beneath the seven cities dead
Encased in silent tombs
Immortally exhumed
Spirit of the elder gods
Are dead but must live on
Still to life and yet they breathe
Dead but dreaming...

As I smear my blood on thy sword
Through the gates into lands I know not
On the road where none have returned
Come to life, Oh lords of black earth

Screaming ancient incantations
Sleep unbinded by my sight
Dead but dreaming, darkloads waking
From the house of death set free

Sixty demons, bow before thy
Ancient catatonia
Elder vengeance, Lord Kur take me
Darklords hear me, hung dead bleeding

Pathetic lives, every second someone dies
Delightful is the sight of repention
No destiny, just a certainty of death
In pain inducing lies of salvation
Never repent...

Born to be dead
Repent to die
Ignorance looms in the unconscious mind
Born to be dead
Repent to die
Waste your last breath on the lord Jesus Christ

Repent to die

Afraid of what lies after death
Your screams are unheard to Him
Resisting your wake of adorn
Your pleading falls deaf on your lord

"Go fuck your god" will be my final words
To die is just the concept of living
To be Forgave, salvation blessed with pain
Endeavored is the blame of creation

Pathetic lives, every second someone dies
Delightful is the sight of repention
No destiny, just a certainty of death
In pain inducing lies of salvation

Blaspheming god, my body was possessed
The essence of their spirits are evil
Burning my flesh, inhaling no regrets
A diabolic sentence of destruction

Burning I bleed, unholy incision
Mark of the beast, behold the trifixion

Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in
Satan's name I desecrate
Evil controlling the way I die
The mark is what distorts my soul beyond my sanity

In the name of Satan
I condemn this image of god
I am a key!...

Blessed by the sign, symbolically I die
Intwist me in the lines of trifixion
Torment, semantic in design
Inflict this mortal shrine,
with pure hatred
Kill me, before my time is lived
It's all I have to give, to be thankful
Satan, entangled in my sores
Forever I am bound by your conviction

Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in

Life has no meaning, unyielding obsession
Grasping at strings of a life I once knew
Death by my own hands, achieving objective
Blade to my throat, I calmly greet death

In Hell I burn, my faith is sustained
In Hell I burn again
In Hell I burn, no questions remain
In Hell I burn for Satan

Opened eyes dream, unheavenly torture
Raping the world of the dead
Burning in Hell and viewing the unseen
Satisfied feasting of flesh

In Hell I burn for Satan

Fear him, fear him, fear him... Satan

Nazarene in the valley of persuasion
To receive last temptations from Lord Satan
"Take a bite" said the serpent "eat of it"
Without no choice to do so, you cannot resist

Impaled crucifixion
Compassion forgot
Eternal damnation
Once upon a cross

Blasphemy laughs at thee
Jesus you've been deceived
Struggling on the cross
Gagging to breathe
Despite your god, question why
You were retrieved by the angel of light

Kill him, kill him, kill him... Satan

Nazarene screaming on his crucifixion
Prophecy in its final contradiction
When you die is when the lie will be believed
Upon the cross, before the world to see

Once upon the cross

Congregation congregated in his house of god
Entombed by their almighty savior
Revelations misinterpreted ignite his flame
Removed from the human equation

Retreat to death in burning flesh
His dead disciples and their son of god
Incineration of their prophecy
Destroyed in failure

You're unannounced and you're unobserved
No longer worshipped in his world
Apocalypse on insanity
Self destruction of hypocrisy

Suffering is yours, no tomorrow
Killed with reason, unbelieved in
In conception, you were warned
Resurrection, christ denied

Congregation immolated with his bastard son
Confused by the rules of engagement
Impregnating you defamated your grace with god
Refused are the gates to salvation

Open the door Jehovah you whore
I am the servant of who rules this world
Archnemesis of your light
One look at me and you know he is I

Run away when confronted with Satan
Always here and forever will be
Your concern for my Lord is becoming
Defecate on your book of belief

Door to door soliciting war
Feeble man with salvation as sword
Disturb and see you will die
For I am of Him in his world you're confined

Why try? World dies, christ hides
When Satan rules his world
Disease, run free, killing
When Satan rules his world
Religion, infliction, obscene
When Satan rules his world
Witness, dismissed, executed
When Satan rules his world

You are the one we despise
Day in day out your words compromise lives
I will love watching you die
Soon it will be and by your own demise

Buried in hypocrisy
Lacerate your faith in god
Morally diseased
On the cross of Calvary your body bashed, defeated, stabbed

Blessing as you hate
Loyal to your enemies
Monetary faith
As him you'll pay for the lies of your prophecy
Satan wants you dead

Kill the christian, kill the christian

Armies of darkness unite
Destroy their temples and churches with fire
Where in his world will you hide
Sentenced to death, the anointment of christ

In due time your path leads to me
Put you out of your misery

The death of prediction
Kill the christian

Kill the christian... dead!

They will say that he loves you, he don't
From their bible they're controlled
His descent they expect in our life
They'll be waiting till they die
Disembark from their path of belief
If in turn will set you free
Cannot live with the fact that they're wrong
That there is no truth in god

Trick or betrayed
Their faith ends in pain
Rip up their bible before is(its?) too late
Time we undo unity
For it is for fools
In this world we don't need

Trick or betrayed

I think you should know
They know it's true
That their book is a hoax
Join us to see through the light
Christ is a scheme and will ruin your life

Trick or betrayed

Why insist on the cross died for us
His infliction never was
They assume that his death brought them life
To be dead will change their minds
When you see what you feel is not real
Disappointment is revealed
Cannot live with the fact that they;re wrong
There is no such thing as god

They Are the Children of the Underworld
In the creation of Anu were spawned
Born of the Earth before the Age of God
With word unwrit, nowhere they're known
Evade destruction in their world below
Their hands reach for our place outside
Bestow their suffering on human life
Nothing will stop them from re-entering
Return to hatred in the heart of man

They are the children of the underworld
Before the heavens they were on the Earth
To desolation and were never heard
"Cry rebirth"

Lords of the plague, seven are they
Born in the mountain of Mashu's magic
Spirits of hate, they have no name
Withered and wicked, the liars in wait

In the creation of Anu were spawned
With deadly vengeance from the ancient Gods
Their place on Earth, their race unknown
Beyond the knowledge of the elder ones
Provoking with our blood to rise
The seven offspring for the sacrifice
Reclaim the power of the crown of death
Enter the body from the temple dead

They are the children of the underworld
Before the heavens they were on the Earth
To desolation and were never heard
"Cry rebirth"

Lords of the plague, seven are they
Born in the mountain of Mashu's magic
Spirits of hate, they have no name
Withered and wicked, the liars in wait

Disemboweled on the altar jesus christ
Entrails in the pentagram circle
Spill his blood and reversing catholic humn
Invocate the onslaught of Satan

Master Lord lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Drink ourselves as you feed
His offering of purity

Bible bleed, hell on Earth has been achieved
Thou will fail before Lord Satan
Casting sin, pissing on their crucifix
Stepping forth into his creation

Master Lord lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Walk His Earth, invade in pain
His christians become the enslaved

What was once is never more
Infernal Lord Father restored
Blinding priest in disbelief
Revenge onto god he has sworn

Destroy the corpse and release my mind
The secrets contemplate the other side
It won't be long until the death of me
A spirit conscious of reality

To be dead is to always be
Close my eyes and return to sand
To be dead is to always dream
Coherent thought but unseen by man

Invisible to human sight
The consequences in his afterlife
Across the line from the ignorant
Inside my mind I do not know sin

To be dead is to always be
Open-eyed in a sleeping mind
To be dead is to always dream
I'm prepared for my turn to die

Inflicting sorrow on the enemy
And to everyone who doubted me
My constant presence will torment the soul
As I stand watching in the other world

To be dead is to always be
Untied from the living flesh
To be dead is to always dream
Unforgiven when I meet with death

Father integrity, perverted secrecy
Molesting innocent children you're trusted with
What is vowed you cannot live, unbound by celibence
Indulge in sacrilege, to serve unto Satan

Manipulate through threats of god's hate
Abhorrently extorted
Molest the faith, confessional rape
Denial is aborted

Exploit the flesh of christian descent
Incesting consent
Alter your life from behind the light
Master Lord Satan decides

Father hypocrisy, exerting fantasy
Persuading innocent children to where you live
What is vowed does not exist, you are in debt to sin
Apologize and plead, begging god for mercy

Scratching at the box, hand stretches from the earth
Deceased before I am dead, denounced since birth
Alone in this dark void, left to deal with my fear
No way to escape the embrace of the dead

Body numb does not respond, my mind sees all
Coroner tags me for burial, ignoring life's call

My body left to rot yet the blood still flows
Lowered down into my plot, the soil is now my home
Release of my soul is impossible to me
When I still possess it how can it be free?

Not dead yet, why am I ignored?
Mourning for the dead
Not dead yet, while I still live
Premature burial, premature

Pronounced dead, I still see I lie motionless
A mind that's still alert while functions cease
Awake, I still am forever trapped
The light of day it now will never be seen

The crawling of the insects, is all that I now feel
Alive upon my flesh, my death is not real

Not dead yet, premature burial
Mourning for the dead, premature burial
Expiration met, premature burial

I still live, premature burial
Kill me, premature burial

Remnants strewn upon the ground,
drag the carcass withered and brown,
sockets crushed powder remaining
on the black puss, undead are preying.
Pulling at the fragments of existence,
suicide for those who cannot relatiate,
coagulated limbs tiredly twist and
tear at the purpose to mutilate.

Straggling across the charred earthen floor.
All are dead few remain, where is the Lord?
Sky is swollen, crimson display.
Tattered fringe of sanity quickly decays.

Your brain now filled with chemical pollution.
Black lungs cilia limp chlorific solution.
All life is scarred, lethal compulsion.
Victim of addictive source sedative induction.

Scattered remains, existence shattered, chaos ordained. Democracy battered.
Scattered remains, existence shattered, chaos ordained. Democracy shattered.

Remnants of withered decay.

Helpless victims extended in the killing crime.
Flesh penetrated, abnormal cells intertwined.
Your life spent, death extended easily.
Homicide accepted pleasingly.

Body deteriorates, rapid decline.
Health is malignant, weakening of the spine.
Skeletal frame erodes in design.
Embroiled in habitat, trapped and confined.

Catastrophic remnants torn down through the ages.
Blood flows free over the faces.
Existence lies tortured morbidly staring.
At what once was theirs that now lies wasted.

Scattered remains, conformity uncontrolled.
Discipline dismantled, serenity shows mold.
Stream of unconsciousness slowly grips your brain.
Mental contortion abscess of pain.

Last light of day smothered now snuffed.
Release of hate conquers what is left of,
Humanity falters, elimination.
Widespread fear, demolition.
Cease of breeding, nullification.
Dark disciples, termination.
Scattered remains, barren defecation.
Ground lies bloodstained, killing ratification.

Apocalypse.

Honed edge of deceasement, carving the sign of evil bliss.
Body left perforated, innocent victim of a twisted sickness.
Face slashed beyond recognition, broken pieces fall from the skull.

Intestinally punctured, bleeding internally.
Bursting shocks of pain, exceed.
Subsequent mutilation, violence infests in a man.
Leaves him burning with anger, outburst from hell.
Suffer with every dying twitch, gored remains of the human shell.
No one left to hear your cries, burcher's soul fails to be satisfied.

Psychotic, deranged, abominated.
Multiple stab wounds, malefic incarnated.
Termination's tool bites unwilling flesh.
Infinite blood can never, can never quench.

Painful suffering attacks the mortal side of real life.
Conscience hears only words advising it to strike.
Alliance with the blade, obsession bores into the mind.
Trail of violence without end, string of corpses left behind.
To avoid the capture of your many mentors.
Forever slicing life to sustain your own.

Burning sensation inflicted.
Leaving the body lacerated and bruised.
Emotions transpired as rage, leaving multiple stab wounds.
Overcome by the malevolence, deprived of an end without pain.
Corpse lies in an alley with inflictions, to rest you pray.

Psychotic, deranged, abominated.
Multiple stab wounds, malefic incarnated.
Termination's tool bites unwilling flesh.
Infinite blood can never, can never quench.

A soul infested with nihilist beliefs leaves it burning abhorred.
Evil intentions covered with disgust, possession undertakes its bloody chore.

Final strike of the mayhemic knife, as he lay gasping.
To become one with the ground.
The last to look upon his eyes is the next to adorn the assasin's crown.

Passing of black, looms over the entity,
Ill omen surrounding all positive thought.
The words of pain trickling off his tongue,
To hear him say this world is done.

Condemnation for the doomsayer,
The raking of hell's garden cultivates no prayer.
He laughs at the unholy blessing of terror,
Fermented in your mind.

Craving an end to existence,
Fleeing life's pleas of surviving,
The winds taste of death,
Set souls free.

Clouds impregnated, with the lust of despair.
Demons congregate, on the eve of strike.
Heaven is dormant, deaf to all cries.
Desperate fools will never find Christ.

Hateful spite lunges from the throat.
Spat upon helpless beings of peace.
Looming in the corridors that lie between time.
This world's broken neck grasped in his hands.

Dark secrets unlocked by a verbal key.
Promises once mocked are fulfilled fatalities precede.

Screams distorted with blood.
Reverberate through vacated lives.
Punished for ignorance.
Extinction is your sentence.

Killing spree unleashed, threshold of pain broken free.
Ignorance of life, to reach with insanity bred to strike.
Once sacrilege, to take the life of another.
Now common practice, to kill each other.
Sadistic ways, portrayal of death done.
Hands grasp at wounds, ongoing penetration.

Deception, plays the role in this game.
Domination, powertrip fools fall to blame.

Washing your hands in the stale pools of blood.
Killing confrontation, unceasing battle wages on.
No self control, murder brings no guilt.
Priorities carried out, no one left to stand.

Revelation, more and more confirmed as time passes by.
Left to burn, carnage fills this endless void.
Rotted minds, the stinking filth of violence floods the air.
Homicidal thoughts flow freely through the head.

Your mind alone, to deal with sin, to now commit,
The need to kill.

Thou shall kill.
Values of God remembered no more.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, obsolete.
Thou shall kill.
Values of God thrown to the ground.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, no more.

Frozen terror locked on a face gone pale.
Taking deliverance, irrational fate.

Abandoned for, the path taken, easier route.
To kill a man, simple gesture, in a world gone mad.
Flowing red, taints all souls the color of death.
Innocence, a word only whispered under breath.

Thou shall kill.
Values of God remembered no more.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, obsolete.
Thou shall kill.
Values of God thrown to the ground.
Tablets, shattered, defaced, no more.

Your mind alone, to deal with sin, to now commit,
Aimlessly kill.
Voices are heard, whispered in pain, mentally sent,
Releasing its command.
Thou shall kill.

Bone marrow twisted, white sockets shattered,
Black flesh blistered, hungry maggots grow fatter.
Tendons snap, cartilage corroding.
Contorted muscles flap, clotted blood flowing.
Circumstances beyond that of your feeble minds.
Helpless victims scream in fear, for they know of their finds.

Carcasses lie piled, some gaping, some rotted.
Yellow pus dripping, putrid and hottened.
Bluing flesh quivers, loosened and bloated.
Final stage of death, rigor mortis unfolded.
Faces of white staring right through you.
This hellish sight knows you're its own fool.
Your hell.

Odor of carrion is thick in the air.
Puddles of mucous, flesh starts to tear.
Innolation intruding on your body and souls.
Immoral adoration, extinction takes its toll.
Viewing this onslaught before me.
Its beauty is so fucking rare.
Take one look and you will see.
Devastation wrought with precision and care.

From his fist, swift death is dealt.
Your head up your ass, much pain is felt.
Body all twitching, brain nerves dead,
In a flick of his eyes, your maker's met.
Sacrificial, sacrificial, sacrificial, annihilation 
Sacrificial annihilation.

Panic has stricken, stiff bodies abound.
Your need to escape, but the means are not found.
Tiny little flesh creatures flee for their lives.
From the plasm he returns, now it's time to die.
Sacrificial, sacrificial, sacrificial, annihilation 
Sacrificial annihilation.

Mutilation, asphyxiation, dying by my grasp.
Futile moves made by you to stop me in my tracks.
Don't you know now as your limbs grow cold.
I am your destruction.
Sacrificial annihilation.

Falls upon a disobedient time.
Holocaust claims the weak and feeble lives.
Sickness wells, bursting within.
No escape from the bludgeon, except to give in.

Deep depression enters your mind.
Premeditated oppression conquers all thought.
Striving with little reason to be.
A wretched subject of this cryptocracy.

The wreath which is weaving, woven full of lies.
Bore out of teachery, it snuffs out your cries.
Spawn on this Earth, to bring out suffering.
Avaricious hunger fulfills its voracious legacy.

A say we don't have, where it's written we shall.
Your life stripped away, destined to fall.

Wanting to die for your faith.
Everything you are is laid to waste.
Blood falls free from your open wounds.
Sets souls free to complete doom.
Dying and killing for your crimes.
Forever your eyes are smitten blind.

Decadence remains the only thing for you.
Self pity and denial, play you for its fool.
Evil takes your life, beckon to its call.
Evil claims your souls, laughing at its fall.
Laughing as you fall.

Hooked up to life's machines, looks of despair as the doctor gleams.
Cannot move, immobilized, see the life slip from their eyes.
Skin so white, pale and loose, try to fight, it's of little use.
To face death and it won't be fast.
To an agonizing end your body's cast.

Injected through the anal, arm, or blood.
Unprotected cells deteriorate, life is done.
Agonizing the way you lead the rest of your wretched life.
Sufferage bound in your own insane hell.

Don't want to die, should have stayed clean.
Now you're going to suffer until the end of your being.

Awaken in sweat, my skin chilled and cold.
May have seen my own death, but can't see what I know.
Attemp to piece it together, illusions of the mind.
Dark starts to alter formations of my find.
Fulmination termination of your life to be.
Malignant euseration that the body cannot flee.
Lachessis upon you signing your epitaph.
Extinction of humanity is far too much to grasp.

Malevolent hatred of life, seeing death fall from the sky.
Resisting the view from my eyes,
Receiving pleasure from watching you die.

Martyrdomic terror flash through yellowed eyes,
Purgatoric laughter fills your hallowed cries.
We are all participants of this malevolent creation.

Streaks of red flying through your tortured mind.
Crowds of undead trying to see unheard crimes.
Blasphemy achieving sadistic malicious intent.
Society is hanging on to greed and selfish threads.
Insidious demon debilitating all souls.
Warmongers infiltrating, blood heavily flows.
Ravenous leaders try to determine our fate.
To these gluttonous regimes we must assassinate.

Malevolent hatred of life, seeing death fall from the sky.
Resisting the view from my eyes,
Receiving pleasure from watching you die.

Martyrdomic terror flash through yellowed eyes,
Purgatoric laughter fills your hallowed cries.
No one can destroy this malevolent creation.

No more inferiority will ruin this, our lives.
To step outside the boundaries of just the will to survive.

Come inside, feel your life, slip from your grasp,
To your religion you clasp.
A fear that is new, pours into you, tearing your soul,
Release the unknown.
Dethroning the old, crowning the young, rightful heir,
The time has come.

Religion has died.
All shall melt under one sign.
Relinquish your life.
A new lease of power has been sent forth.
The weak can only cry.
Lost amongst the dust of a crumbling world.
Last breath fails, time to move on, evolution calls.

Worlds collide, the weak step aside.
Our callings heard, no mercy will come.
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood.

This time has been anticipated, since the dawn of man.
Hatred silently brewing, awaiting its final stand.

Our rule, our... RULE!
The advantage is ours, gathering the powers of the past.
Tensed forth to aggress, deal a strike with precision crass.

Worlds collide, the weak step aside.
Our callings heard, no mercy will come.
The path is cleared, paid for with your blood.
Now that the time has dawned upon us,
Allocate your inner soul.
Seize now, this opportunity.
Retribute your malevolence handed down.

Rounded up, herded in, innocence severed.
Tortured, various phases, in witness of family you die.

Hot steel prods into your eyes.
Executioner nods, optics spew.
Tanks roll forward claiming lives.
Focus of death, nothing new.

Innocent families left to die.
Soldiers murder, God defied.
Iron fist falls heavy with lust.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.
Systematic execution.

Military machines, steel warped with hate.
Death from above, precision bombing translates final acts.
Engines whine, tear through the night.
Weary low morale, caught up in the sights.

Soldiers march, take your land.
Resistance end in slaughter.

Dying screams clutter the sands.
Echoing sounds, chaotic laughter.
The sun is killed, behind a blackened sky.
The son is killed, a father watches him die.

Systematic execution.
Playing God with his thoughts.
No retribution.
Forever the souls will haunt.

Wings of death carry your carcass into the realms of terror.
Crushed beneath the wheels of war.
Doctrine of greed violently implored.

Mind of the tormented, twisted arcane.
Born from the black bowels of hate.
Psychotic cringe, from any light of good.
The sight of blood is only understood.
Piercing the body to release the life.
Another soul to steal, stalking in the night.

Feel the wrath of a soul wired to the core of pure power.
Power sent to crush, mean to destroy and dismantle.
Wielding tools of demise set to conquer lives,
Total retribution.
No lives are spared, his goal, his hate.
His hate, this hates, his hate.
IT HATES!

The seething feeling writhes from inside.
Now you taste the corners of its mind.
Its acrid bile clutches at your throat.
Rips you open, achieving attack mode.

Your body is not your own, subconscious overthrown.
Corpse still warm lying still.
Another body bag to fill.

Slaughter of innocence.
Die motherfucker!

Blood upon his blade, set fourth to annihilate.
Crushing life and limb to dust.
Never enough to fulfill his bloodlust.

Random kill of chance, victim of innocence.
Can not be silenced. Instinct to murder.

Tasting the power to destroy.
Any means of deceasement, stand employed.
Contact of steel into warm flesh.
Crimes of the mind to fully infest.
Take full credit for the kill.
Urge again burns inside, result is homicidal.


The entity must slay to survive.
Feel no remorse, has no conscience for its crimes.
Legacy to kill until the end of time!

Coronation of this our domain.
Only the strong and dominant shall remain.
Ancestral power granted, this our night.
Inheritance never relinquished, endure the plight.

Fools fall backwards.
Passion for victory, never in sight.
The feeble falling victim to the aggressive.
To the aggressive this night.

To lose a life or take a life.
Your just cause rewarded.
Hindered on the battlefield by nothing or no one.
Death exploited.
Taste the blood, smell the victory in the air.
Yellowed eyes take in the dead stare.
The rule shall govern under one allegiance.
Our realm, our dominion.

The authority that has been bestowed.
Will flourish when it's ripe.
All empires that stand around us.
Will decay and fade from sight.

Coronation of this our domain.
Coronation of this dominion.

This coronation.
Intrepid preservation!
Self realization.
Feel the supremacy all around you.
Granted powers to survive.
Your soul forever immortal.
Regain strength of all past lives.
The throne allocated upon us.
The key to sovereign rule.
No more are we looked upon as common.
The reign of power is true.
Coronation.

Never to give in, bred from the start to always win.
Waiting for this day to come, always within our grasp.
Faltering and the weak lay gathered at our feet.
Decimating fools, genocide is our link.

Fools fall backwards.
Passion for victory, never in sight.
The feeble falling victim to the aggressive.
To the aggressive this night.

Crowning of this sovereign can wait no longer.
Inner hostilities force the surfacing.
Violent traditions altered beyond fate.
Your crumbling society denied, ESCAPE!

Humor is found, body hits the ground.
Bullet finds its path, television contracts.

Contagious, the art of violence.
Relinquish society's doctrine.
The blood spills, smeared on the walls of life.
Humanity ignoring these calls.

Murder so popular in these turbulent times.
Spectator sport, anticipation of the crime.
The masses hinged on the stroke of a knife.
It's not if they died but how they lost their life.
Killing heart is now put aglow.
Now the murder's right, it shakes off the cold.
The next victim up shall be privileged to go!

New age of death distinctly understood.
Era of violence in heavy demand.
Every mind is set in a blood - frenzied mood.
Past state of violence now in reprimand.
Witness of the crime, an audience refined.
Death dealt with glamour - making headlines.
Assault was never sweeter, applauded by the crowd.
Condoned decimation, serial killer stands proud.

Contagious, the art of violence.
No flesh, no flesh shall be spared.

Slicing of the flesh, adrenaline, scared to die.
Take in your last breath, bidding your time.
Movies, news and tabloids, money making crime.
Murder's exploitation, selfish greed inclined.

When we're done laughing at this violence.
Violent carnage will be laughing back.

This entertainment that we seek.
Is the power poised to attack.

Blood is the trophy carried in your hands.
Carnage is the prize, weighs heavy in demand.
Who is the mightiest killer in this land?
He who takes first place and acquires the most fans.

Contagious, the art of violence.
No flesh, no flesh shall be spared.

Pain and suffering fall on the mortal world.
The life you're given is your living hell.
Brought up on tumultuous times.
Accumulation of this the killing crime.

Gunsmoke blazes, glochs crack.
Casket encases, bodies stack.
Kill for the stature of this game.
Yearn to kill or learn to die lame.
Drugs or money, not always the main cause.
It's how many lives snuffed outside of the law.
To not take a life is your life lost.

Load in the rounds, take a victim down,
claiming his ground.
Never doubt your gun, just get the deed done,
claim your trophy in blood.
For drugs or for war, or the lust of the sport,
attention to the poor.
GUNPLAY!

Spray of the shot, lead lands hot.
Ending the game on the coroner's cot.
Taking of lives, ignoring the cries.
Only the coldest survive!

Fear of a world turned dark with despair.
Any way out other than violence is all too rare.
Only way to win is take the other one out first.
The unbridled violence is this modern day curse.
WAR - ZONE!

Gunsmoke blazes, glochs crack.
Casket encases, bodies stack.
Kill for the stature of this game.
Yearn to kill or learn to die lame.

Spray of the shot, lead lands hot.
Ending the game on the coroner's cot.
Taking of lives, ignoring the cries.
Only the coldest SURVIVE!

Seize the pipe, offer your life,
Inhale this obsession.
Filling the lungs of minorities youth,
Coincidental connection?

The sickness spreading,
Into their lives,
Free-base infecting.
Who will pay for their lives?

The gullible one grabs his gun,
Sticks it to your head.
For a piece of smoking disease,
Squeeze the trigger until tour dead.
Mind is thrown in disarray,
For a vice, unconscious slay.
Governmentally induced,
No one except yourself to blame.
No one to blame,
Suicide this game.

Shell of a man left to wither and die.
Deteriorating waste, ignoring his mind's cry.
Addiction continues, more population to abuse.

Expanding into your lungs,
Banish your right of thought.
Tasting your foul sorrow,
Sickening trend of this plot.
Is this what your soul commands?
How much rock can you smoke?
Easy prey for government plans,
Take this genocidal toke.

One gesture and his bidding is done.
Lost souls in search of a man to be delivered into his hands.

Ordering his flock to murder on command.
These the twisted thoughts of one single man.

Now that you have become one with his mind.
Death inclined, can't escape the mindlock.

One word falls from his lips.
Blood adorns their knives.
Taste the innocence as it drips.
Taking control of the unknown.

His word is their law, never to be broken.
Vow of silence is taken on.
Captured in this trance of his mind - lock.

Experiencing life through the finality of death.
All tongues lash at the air.
Tasting your last breath.
Mindlock.

The command once more set forth.
To conquer all of the living world.
His way of murder will always endure.
Population exposed to hatred.

Body count rapidly advancing.
Violence rises from decay.
Rampant bidding, well entranced.
Rid the world of all the LIVING!

Life marked for the hit,
Before a man that's sworn to hate,
to plan his kill, premeditate.

Contracts are signed, victim dies,
Tools of the trade, build to slay,
No detail left to careless thought.

Relentless pursuit of accuracy,
the touch of death, addicted needs.
Whatever it takes to make you bleed,
Gunning for you now.

Heed the call of his brain,
Self taught and killing trained,
Can never lose the game.

Excitement and adrenaline instilled,
living for the thrill to kill.
Embrace the chase and the stalking.

Cold polished steel, tight in his fist. With vigor,
looking over the victims on his list.
The power possessed keeps his life sustained,
the power invested is to power to slay.

Plead for your life.
This makes his smile wide.
Please don't take my life.
Enjoy your begging now you... Die!

Can never feel repent,
Can never feel remorse,
Just set to fulfill his violent course

Excitement and adrenaline instilled,
Living for the thrill to kill.
Embrace the chase and the stalking.

Play again and again,
Play as much as he can,
Play until the very end.

Feel no pain,
Never loss, only gain.
A killer who's quite sane.

I've done it always...
as far as you've known or heard...
There isn't too many things I haven't tried...
no matter has it was done, I mean I've known guys
that went to sleep and never woke up again,
I mean, you know...

To enact my destiny

We are the obscure terror

We endanger all that be

Strength through adversity
Death with nobility
Instruments of insurgency

Why hinder thou from escaping obscurity
Thus dominating your race

Of impurities
For it is I who will conquer
This plane of existence

Heed not for our scrolls
For our text hath no path
Of deviation
For it is I who will transcend to
This plane of existence

We must appease the gods
For fear of obliteration
We fast as part of our offerings
As we pray for the sun and
The rain to appear

I shall exact my revenge
For I am the top of the hierarchy
Heir to a tradition of unification
For I am the mother and the father
And the heart of our domain
I am the wiseman
I am a thing of evil

Awaken from below I call thee
Thy master pure in darkness
The one of hate before thy paths
Were chose to be forsaken
From depths of time in portals
Through empty eyes of light
I searched the texts for knowledge
Now I bleed the sacrifice
I am of purest power
Strengths of a thousand souls
I hear the voices of
The oldest ones burning within
Reveal the truth unto me
For I'll command the worthy
March through the ruins of
Diminished tribes

Beyond redemption!

In vein of sacred scriptures
Prodive the sight and visions
The lusting of hypocrisy
Forever scars the soul
Cursed is the life once given
Your prayers obsolite
The termination of the myths
You've led yourself to believe
I summon winds of fire
I summon winds of disease
I summon torture upon
All my rivalries who shall bleed
Confronting all before me
To tempt what I have in store
Don't tempt my fury for
The flames shall burn eternally

Beyond redemption
Aftermath of ashes and dust
Beyond redemption
The weak shall lie beneath the earth
Beyond redemption
You shall weep upon the feast I feed

I summon winds of fire
I summon winds of disease
I summon torture upon
All my rivalries who shall bleed
Confronting all before me
To tempt what I have in store
Don't tempt my fury for

Born by fire now force thy ways
I am the entity
I hold the chalice
The praise of demi-gods my oath to thee
Behold majestic strengths
Amongst the chosen ones
To desecrate, dominate
All enemies that dare to rise

We are the coming of the scorned messiah
Apocalyptic seeds
The loathing of your arrogance ordained
In absence of the souls in withered lies
Defeating all that stand
Conceration of the frails demise

Impending visions of prophecies
Await the dormancy
To seek our path
The path of righteousness, eternal bliss
Possess the rites of time
To thee of virgin blood
Now desecrate, dominate
The ones that shall be left behind

Born by fire!

Apocalyptic seeds

In absence of the souls in withered lies
Defeating all that stand

To only realize that we command
The armies of the dark shall form in flame
Destroying forgery
You cannot fool the eyes of the gods

You are the plague of humanity!

Why is it that you deny
the realization of truth while
creating an actualization of lies?

Your intolerance for loyalty
in acceptance of the indignity,
the irony of the civilized world.
You are the plague of humanity!

It was not always so,
this insolence so insipid.
For where there is truth
there are only lies.

Is there in truth no pride

For where there is fact,
deception only lies.

I'll say it once, I'll say it again,

the inevitability of your life and death.
Menace to whom we consider frail,
hierarchy of this planet.

It is our will, it is...

These final days are upon us...

Is this the final judgement of our time,

Never again shall I believe in your lies!

Hate! Hate! I demand my vengeance
Hate! Hate! I shall never retreat
Hate! Hate! Suffer through insurmountable pain
You coward, you Judas

The betrayer of all
Are we the flock of sheep led to extinction
Or a swarm of locusts who shall prevail

Archetype of foul
Cataclysmic beast of the abyss
Unto thee now shall all you fall

Is it the beacon of hope as deemed to some
Or the coming of apocalyptic scorn

May the stars drop from the heavens
The sun shall transform to black
I shall make the moon cry blood
Usher in the new age of man

Born out of exile

Therefore guard the sacred yew
For death is the path to wonder

Shall I burn in the everlasting fire
Now desolate in black
Growing fears of the end of mankind

Unimaginable horror
Unspeakable suffering
Or just the quiet after the storm

Unparalleled evil
Unification of purity
Or canonised at the end of days

Thorns of Acacia
The threshold that unites the plane of life and death
Merging the paths of the dark and the light

Onward to the realm of immortality
The passage from this mortal coil
In death salvation exists

Unimaginable horror
Unspeakable suffering
Or just the quiet after the storm

Unparalleled evil
Unification of purity
Or canonised at the end of days

Thorns of Acacia

Messenger of the word
With vengeance shall you striketh down
Bring forth the world to your knees
Tempter of all that is sacred
Curse and shake the ground upon you
Return from exile, reclaim what once was yours

Haunting abound - For I shall be known

Ravager of the abyss
Legend of unequalled power
Cast out tribulations amongst mankind

All shall honour him
All shall praise him
The personification of evil
All shall worship him
All shall honour him

The beast now has arisen

Emerging out of shadows and the mire
The ghost of the past now awakens
Sound the trumpets of death, signifying rebirth
Unveil the prophetic curse

Haunting abound
Adversary to all that appose
The fallen now has risen
Haunting abound

Haunting abound
You shall attempt to strike me down
Yet I shall bring the arrival of the end
Haunting abound

Haunting abound
Your ominous presence so profound
For the shadow of death shall rise
Haunting abound

Conquer thy rebellion, destroy thy pristine

Bold, I must revel in the obliteration of the monotheist, so called mighty lord
Crush all man, burn down the temple of hope
Persecution of all your saint's ideals

Behold, the end of days awaits
Whilst redemption now is at hand

The art of redemption
The final battle is at hand
Avenge me legions and hordes of abandon
Triumphant in our stand

Confront me tyrant, absolve me messiah
Defy, I shall defy all those whom choose the path of lies
Lies, you cannot hide from nor deny
I cast thee out, out amongst slaves
Slaves amongst thieves, thieves amongst the fray
Amongst the fray may vengeance destroy you all
For victory now is within our grasp

The art of redemption
The final battle is at hand
Avenge me legions and hordes abandon
Triumphant in our stand

The art of redemption
With vengeance we shall command
In discipline we revolt against the tyranny
Defiant in our stand

Path of fury, wrath of many
Insipid and insolent in our ways
Destroy all with pure ferocity
Vindication through annihilation

Redemption, retaliate
Redemption, obliterate
Redemption, annihilate
Redemption, we rule this world

Rise! Open up the skies
Striketh down upon a thousand suns

Rise! By the hand of our maker
Riseth from the ashes of our sins

Fire spirit, once reduced to ashes
Now reborn anew to thrive again
Immortalised, a resurrected spirit
Reveal thyself at the apex of destiny

Benevolent, fierce in its wake
Once consumed in flames, only now to rise again
Extravagant, imperial shape
Essence of divine power
O' mighty scavenger of woe
Brilliant and majestic
With illuminated shine

Mythical one, the dream that never dies
Manifestation of whom now are gone
Legendary, thy bird of prey
Symbolic one, akin to the sun god

Benevolent, fierce in its wake
Once consumed in flames, only now to rise again
Extravagant, imperial shape

Burial act what has existed for the ages

True portrait of the genius that is man

I have journeyed through anguish and pain
Tragedies etched upon my soul
Upon my voyage I've endured adversity
Boils the blood that runneth through my veins

May the blood flow free
Like rivers amidst the great storms
Awaken the calm of still waters
With malice and spite, I am reborn

Of loathsome calling, I now am hatesworn
My disdain, it now engulfs me, I now have become hatesworn

Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn, Hatesworn

You shall weep upon your untimely deaths

Almighty winds
Carry us away
Away into the new dawn
Into oblivion

Almighty winds
Sweep us away
Away into a new era
Into oblivion

Lake ablaze, the lake of burning fire
Cast alive into dusk
Deceived by the lie of eternal life
Hence burneth in the lake of flames

Burning desire of sin

Lake ablaze, o' great sea of fire
That dwelleth beneath the Earth

Rise upon the great clouds of smoke

Cast out asunder into the dark waters
Upon the sect of false prophets
Perished, unto the sea of fire
Transgressions of whom amongst the flesh

Hear my prayers
King of the majestic crown
Grant them eternal rest

In the name of the dark lord
As the abyss shall swallow them whole

From the sea shall riseth
The titan of all so bold
At the behest of the heavens
In the face of the creator of all
Shall you tremble with fear
While the skies fall upon us
Are you striken with fear
While you burn in complete unrest

Burn!
Burn!
Burn!
Burn!

May thy flame burn strong
May thy flame scorch the skies

I am the winds that blow
Earth shattering waves that ever flow

Upon the vast horizon

May the skies open upon your command
Transfixed, I say unto you
May thy sparrows carry you away
Into the eclipse

I am the moon that ever so shines
In death comes rebirth, now granted in time
I am now floating amongst dream woven clouds
Upon the path of the righteous shrouds

Glory be to your memory
May you fear no longer
All shall bow down in awe
Honor bestowed upon your legacy

The fire of resurrection
Void of burden, no regrets
The fire of resurrection

Insidious in their nature
All-consuming everlasting void

Clouds of tribulation
It spreads across the land
Wrath of the ancients

Skies of condemnation
Haze of all illumination
Blotting out the face of the sun

Why have you forsaken us?
Why must all now come to an end?
Cursed I beseech thee
May thy abolishment
Come to an abrupt end!

Darkened regions of the sea
Engulfed in blackness of the ancient sky
I must travel through the realm
Of tenebrous depths
Amidst the darksome empire

Lost of all illuminated sight
Aloft amongst the waves of torrid fray
Wandering undaunted, thousands fathom deep
Amidst tumultuous clouds of flame

The stygian deep
Thus his curse has now fallen
As you ascend into glorified lands
Whilst I descend into ominous black
The stygian deep
Entrenched in overwhelming ire
Enameled by fury and destructive rage
Whilst I drown in absolute madness

Rise, infernal serpent of the sea
Embrace me as I fall into
The darkest of the dark
Transport me, hand in hand, on my path
Into my dreamlike state
Of my outer body being

Drowning waters of the 'mare
Blinded in the shadows of the dim abyss
I must venture through the somber
Caliginous depths amongst
The sullen empire

Lost within the arms of endless dark
Afloat upon the swell of heaving surge
Sweeping undulating drift
Amidst tumultuous waves of flame

The stygian deep
Thus his curse has now fallen
As you ascend into glorified lands
Whilst I descend into ominous black
The stygian deep
Entrenched in overwhelming ire
Enameled by fury and destructive rage
Whilst I drown in absolute madness

As I look into the distance from afar
With a broad view
I sweep the void of influx
Treading waters upon
My inevitable death
May I once again be at one
With my predestined death (fate...)

My last breath...
My final call...
My dying omen...
My endless pain...

Inconsequential
A sea of foul invertebrates
I beseech the providence
To infuse the essence of the beast

Create my army
From withered vine and spineless mollusk
Rise up deliver!
Bring forth the evil pervading

I visualize thy core
Beast creates reality
With each slothful act
A string is bored into thy skin

Why would thou innovate
When all is naught
The end complete
Call to me
For deliverance

Now behold thee,
Resurgence of the mendicants
Accursed worms of the earth befall thy fate
Subtle, insidious,
Slaves by sloth and bled by writ
Infecting the populace
By chains of resentment

Now behold thee, prophetic visions awaken
Army through infiltration
No intervention by the beast
The blood split in triumph
Turned to ashes of devastation
No sorrow lost as the beast again arises

Call upon thy savior
I will take responsibly
Thy burdens laid upon me
Just trade resolve for apathy

Join the infantry of servants
Beholden to archaic intention

Modus operandi
With perverse aspirations
I peddle my poison
Under shroud of apocalyptic knowledge
Leviathan of arrogance,
Bear strings into the peasant skin

Now behold thee
Resurgences of the mendicants
Accursed worms of the earth befall thy fate
Subtle, insidious,
Slaves by sloth and bled by writ
Infecting the populace
By chains of resentment

Now behold thee, prophetic visions awaken
Army through infiltration,
No intervention by the beast
The blood spilt in triumph
Turned to ashes of devastation
No sorrow lost as the beast again arises

Why would thou - Sacrifice thy kingdom?
No gain can cometh
When offer spirit to the winds
Relinquish empires for momentary nothings
Swallow thyself into the depths of my snares

Worthless servant, specter of the crown
Crown of thorns, the one whom shall destroy
Slave of worthless pursuits
Aloft upon the throne of lies

Born, again
Born again from foulness defined
Deliverance from the empire
You once left behind

O woe to generations come
Behold thyselves as victims

Sloth, the deadliest of sins
As the ancients decreed, shall be
Consecration of external masters
Shell remains, as beast anointed

The dark cloud is now among us
Churning forth the black plague,
Engulfing all being
Such hope is now abandoned
The full force is now against us

Stricken down by strength of skyward call
All aspirations are now deceased

The plane of our existence now torn apart
Burned of recognition, scorched by fire
Fire of outer darkness
Lost amongst the everlasting smoke
Disintegration almost now complete
Destruction of all beings
Being of the anointed enlightened kind
Punishment ensues for the wicked

Cleansing the planet of all false prophets

Lord of duality
Son of our supreme almighty lord
Cometh forth upon us mere mortals
Grace us with your power divine
Bless us with your power infernal
Abhor us with your disdain

Upon this netherworld of flame
The abode of death
It welcomes me with open arms
As it is so
Emerging from the darkest shadows
Lies truth beyond life
Eternal fire envisaged
As it must be... ave infernus

He who now must enter
Bow down before your maker
And to what end
Shall you prey
For we know not what is to come
Kneel down, gaze upon your master
Amidst the smoke of uprising host
For all that has befallen you
May your penance pave thy way

Shall I descend into darkness
Torn asunder til' death
What occupies me is everblack
For it hath overcome my soul
Afloat upon the seas of void
In bleak depths of tide
Washed ashore upon the Styx
Ave infernus

He who now must enter
Bow down before your maker
And to what end
Shall you pray
For we know not what is to come
Kneel down, gaze upon your master
Amidst the smoke of uprising host
For all that has befallen you
May your penance pave thy way

Time to say farewell to our father of mankind
Lamentation of a life once known
Time to say farewell
Time to say farewell
To all you hold sacred
Time to say farewell to our father of mankind

Forbidden, one of thee, strength in thee
Anointed by the almighty chosen few
Configured as a source of infinite power
Convoluted with his principals of death
Turmoil ensues

The chosen one
The chosen one

To some he is the representation of doom
To others, the final bastion of hope
With time it shall now all reveal itself
Unparalleled evil, as the end of times draw near

The chosen one
We shall conquer all unite as one
The chosen one

With knowledge so vast
He shall seize strength from the weak
Feeding thy all mighty powerful supreme being
Unveil the deities of darkness
Under the regime of the ultimate beast

May it be fulfilled for he is now among us
The longstanding curse of his prophetic fear
All consuming, this figure of profound dead
The return of the formation of evil

Excision of the diseased, termination of mankind
Is this inhumane and abhorrent
Or is this the zenith between all powers
The unearthly embodiment of evil
Create an unholy path of no return
Cometh forth eternal idol
Bring forth the dawn of a new era...

In the face of annihilation
We must rise and defeat all enemies
For thou shalt not falter upon fear
As to create, so we must destroy
May I die honorably upon a glorious death
For I have no shame of my underlying fate
Shall our armies assemble with disdain
Defeating all false legions of the ordained

Zealot, crusader of war
Arise!
May we reign in all mankind's demise

Zealot, crusader of war
Arise
May we cleanse as the instrument of lies

Shall you be still as I avenge thee
As it shall be our rebirth of our very being
Liar in wait, corruptor of the flesh
Vengeance is the only way to providence
Our intent is to create and thus destroy
For within the growth shall now be on course
Inflicting death upon the opposition
Enduring puritanical nobility

Grandeur within our design
Sceptre in hand
I shall avenge thee
Against the radical rebellion
Harbinger of vengeance
Rise to prominence
As divine purpose
Notorious with vision amongst the slain

Effusion of blood
Harrowing times of reformation
Darkened silhouette
Against the bloodstained tide

Sheer horror
Disaster and famine
Siege of disease

Forces invade
Strong and cruel
Flee in terror
Advancing rampant force
Prepare for the storm of cleansing
May you now be forewarned
Prepare for dire consequence
May you now be forewarned

Zealot, crusader of war
Heathens to all now disavowed
Paradox to the almighty revenge

Like fathers bowed to me
Looked upon infernal majesty
Constructing empires on graves

Your being, depends on me
Concede to utter blasphemy
Thy will is weak, accursed progeny

Relinquish existence
Forefathers forsake you
Call out to them not
As they exalt my very shroud

By stealth enslavement of the will
Subordinate identity
Phantom profane at thy behest...

Antediluvian orders
To subjugate the proletariat
Upon my brow is written the fiat of death
Born only to serve our master,
The mighty destroyer

...Kneel

My craft is simple
Thou victims of the id
My reign is infinite profanity

Thy will is freedom
Thy heart is bondage
Indiscretions fall upon the children

Thy mothers bear homage
Thy fathers renounce thee
Phantom profane deliver them

Antediluvian orders
To subjugate the proletariat
Upon my brow is written the fiat of death
Born only to serve our master,
The mighty destroyer

I devalue
I dilute thee
Reproduction by relativism
Complacency is my weapon
(You're) prostrate before me

Hunger - Feed thy baseness, indulge
Thy will is mine
Sycophant - Herd thy family, entrapping
Thy heirs are mine

Deception intrinsic
Detection derision
Illusion defined

Aspiration discomfited
The earth is mine

Thou wilt fulfill
The orders of the arcane scripture
Begot by the beast,
Mankind's torment decreed

O' how I beckon thee
To hear my calling
As I stretch forth to the inevitable void
Take me away from this darkness
Release me from my pain of this endless cycle

Aeons of suffering endured
As I fade into oblivion
Into the cavern of cold dark shadows
Slowly I submerge into the abyss
The abyss of bliss

O' dark lord cometh forth
For I know not your name
Yet I have no fear for thee
Purveyor of all that is wicked

O' majestic being, hear my call

O' how I summon thee
To hear my calling
On my journey into eternal damnation
Must I endure your wrath
Bound by the oath I swore
What hath now befallen me
I swear to burn the eternal flame

Yet my sorrow you shall feed upon
Though I shall be among the dead
Through martyrdom of flame
My affliction will cause no shame
Am I not the one who shall receiveth
The mark of the befallen

O' dark lord cometh forth
For I know not your name
Yet I have no fear for thee
Purveyor of all that is wicked

O' majestic being, hear my call

Listen to the sound of my chant
Spirits from the beyond
Listen to the sound of my chant
Those whom lurk in the shadows
Of the corners of bleak

As the dust settles
Grant me eternal life by your masterful design
May your ominous presence shake the earth
May your power define the end of my travels

I am the author of death

Behold, for thy vision is in our midst
In the shadows of the purest transcendence
Time is a river ever flowing
For death is the everlasting cycle of life
Shall I embellish the seas of change
Must I embrace this departing life
For all mankind shall fall before us
The wicked that shall engulf the earth

I am the composer of pain
Centuries of accumulative drought
I am the composer of pain
Aeons of assimilation destroyed
I am the composer of pain
The storm that no one shall escape
I am the composer of pain
Initiate the command to destroy

Behold, as he permeates through the land
For it is he and only he who can absolve us
Savior of salvation
Or demigod of malice
Transcending the knowledge of days once born
Beneath the lies of rhetoric
Scolding rainfall
Shall wash us away off the face of this scorched earth

For in the beginning there was naught
Creator of the damned, exiled into solitude
I succumb to your infinite power
I embrace your curse of humanity's fall
I succumb to your infinite power

Out of the dark landscape
Is the fall of this ancient land
The scale and enormity of this disaster
Nothing at all remains
Decimated by the will of our gods
Leaving all in ruin
Out of the heavens came the furnace of flames
With ignited infernos
Fires spread across the lands
Absolving ancient cities in its path

Leaving devastation in its wake
Flash floods creating liquified ground
Under the veil of deceit and disdain
A catastrophe of devastating power

Ruins of a lost civilization
What lies beneath the waves of despair
The collapse of glorious land and its downfall
As the world crumbled beneath their feet

Unveiled wonders of a time now passed
Searing ash and burning flesh
The avalanche of doom
In the marsh lies remains of the past
Terrifying sight of death
The favor of the gods

The haunting ruins is what lies beneath
Sheer savagery and brutal viciousness
It shattered the foundations of society
Within the demise of a land once thriving
Absolve me

Under the blazing sun lies a world of phenom
The fabled palace upon the mountains
Stranded in puritanical sand
The empire of the lost temples

With vengeance I must striketh down
Thy enemies of our kingdom
Fled and sheltered by the flock of angels downtrodden
Cast out by the sacred
Bound and shackled till extinction
Now withered away into darkness
Erased from the annals of history
Have you no mercy

In the stillness of black
I shall destroy the world
Of purpose and desire from spite
I have spoken, I have arisen

Salvation lies ahead
Or shall we wither away into darkness
Devastating in thy authoritative approach
I shall activate an emerging threat of doom
Culminating into a storm of beckoning cries
Disintegration of all that once was
We must dismantle this society of lies
Society of lies

Following ones path into the light
Punished from the wrongs of our kind
Annihilation of this sacred land
The task that now must be complete

Detestable, deplorable, yet fleeting in all its glory
There shall not be any noble deaths
For the world as we know it is now absolved
Iniquitous, malevolent, born evil from thy inception
Conjuring this catastrophic drought
Seizing earth's precipitating fall

You shall become descendants of my own image
I shall reign over the wonder of awe
I shall impose scarcity over man
As your penance is the downfall of all

Life so sacred yet here I stand
Cursed with sorrow and a penchant for death
May I enter the void of loss
In the presence of those whom have perished

As I enter the chasm of emptiness
The mythos tells no lies
Mournful spirits fill the air
Lingering amongst the dead

In the labyrinth of terrifying fear
The winds sweep across the trees
Pulling me into their lair
Filled with troubled thoughts of death

The forest of broken dreams and shattered lives
Upon the sea of trees
Lies the depth of all our sorrows
Nothingness of being
I am only a shadow of what was I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I

Shunned by the light of the sun
In the realm of hazy dense despair
What sadness lies before me
Awaiting the ghosts of those left to die

As I enter this majestic sprawl
Banished, never to return again
Vengeful thoughts and woeful wounds
An absolute end

In the maze lost upon volcanic rock
Where the veils are transparent
Vestiges of a culture unknown
The universe within us all

The forest of broken dreams and shattered lives
Upon the sea of trees
Lies the depth of all our sorrows
Nothingness of being
I am only a shadow of what was I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I

Wounds that no one can heal
Pain that never subsides
Scars... scars that never shall fade

Shall the spirit of the winds engulf me
May the ghosts of the past resolve
May I leave this world behind
In the shadows of yurei absolve

Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I
Nothing, nothing but a shell left as I

I see the everlasting face of death and our demise
Shadows of the promised land, spare us our own reprise

The scorched they prevail
Haunted evil
The tortured prevail
Wicked evil

I see your embers fall as you hide in pure disgrace
I watch your spirit fall as you fade into oblivion

O' woeful angst of pure despair
May war and destruction prevail

I hear your endless cries as you
Writhe in sheer distress
I feel your soul now slip away into the endless dark
I sense the numbing void as it
Permeates the land
Now through me I am the vessel of the overcome I stand

The scorched they prevail
Haunted evil
The tortured prevail
Wicked evil

I see your embers fall as you hide in pure disgrace
I watch your spirit fall as you fade into oblivion

Cower no longer for your time has come
For the mantra of lies are now upon us

O' woeful angst of pure despair
May war and destruction prevail

We have all demolished our idols
All of humanity fails
All has fallen of what we cherish
Obliterated by catastrophic epic proportions
All of what we have known now destroyed

Hopelessness has now set in
As the actualization of our fate arrives
May we find the tranquil end
From this endless scourge

Oracle of the dead
Channeling energy through the tapestries of history
The power of the gods
Through the annals of thy lost text

Absolved of all left rendered
In the labyrinth upon the river styx
The boatman now directs your course
To the sorcery of the blessed

Spirits of the dead
I bestow upon you this offering of blood
As I commune with the dead
In the realm of the ones whom have perished

Transcendence as a conduit to the gods
I prey to meet my end
Outerworldly existence I must find
I prey to meet my end

I must pay homage to our ancestors
Who reside in the netherworld
My life defined by death
I shall not run from the darkness

Hence I shall embrace what lies beneath
The descent into the chamber of dark
Portal of the shaman
Sorceror of the possessed
We are the madness that lurks within

Fear is the beast that swallows mankind
Fear has many faces
Messenger of fire, weaponizing fear
Deities scribed into the annals of death

Seeer of what lies beyond
Medium to the spirits now gone
Upon the chambers of what now eternal lie
In the netherworld of the beyond

In our darkest realm, the lair of descent
The heat burneth beneath my feet
Shaman, speak thy name
In the portal of myriad
Prophetic in absolution
In the grotto beyond the lake of sorrow
The sibyl now grants thy command
As I descend unto the caverns of baia

Total collapse into a sudden end
Of unimaginable horror into the dark unknown
The old kingdom of prosperity no longer
Now degraded into complete unrest

Horrendous depredation
Haunting echoes of tragedies that befell the kingdom
Under charred embers of what remained
Under charred embers of what remained

The sandstorms smothered all the lands
Starvation followed, as resources diminished
Agony over fear of whom survives
The end of the kingdom that once was...

Horrendous depredation
Haunting echoes of tragedies that befell the kingdom
Under charred embers of what remained
Under charred embers of what remained

Devastating wide spread famine and misery
Was the end of all they knew
The scale of unbearable suffering
The dark age of ruin

The floods subsided into survi̇val
Yet the floods had caused the end
Once resiliant as it vanished into ash
From achievement into total chaos

Through atrocities with suffering of despair
Eating of the young commenced
Blasphemies committed in order to survive
Not of rhetoric, hieroglyphics tell no lies

Streaks of black ash line the ground
As the lands turned into churning dust
Revealing the truth of once was
The lake of truths has now vanished

The lake of truths has vanished

Consume me, o' vastness of what lies before me
May I be reborn in your own very image
Revel in the sights of your very essence
Upon this journey I must embark upon
Enamored by your purist beauty
Entranced with your absolute authority

Why must this land of gold depart me
Why must you swallow me whole
On this continual path...

Waters rushed the sands with rapid force
Thrusting one's power unto thee
It drifted upon our glorious shores
Gouging the stones from the earth
Removing all life to considerable depths
Amongst the windswept dunes of mass deposits
Upon the shifting tides of sweltering heat
Depletion of your granular sands
Destruction of your identity

As I meander across this desolate floor
I traverse upon the surface of decay
On a distant shore I now no longer fear
I prey for the definitive end

Hear my cries, as they shatter the universe
Feel my longing, as I ponder on days of old
A life once known to me aeons ago...

Decreasing mass surrounds me
Floods overcome our grounds
Creeping upon the floor of the tide
Marked the sign of the curse
Ever so weakening, powerful, indestructible
Scraping the filth off the earth
Dominating, devastating now rendered unusable

Why must this land of gold depart me
Why must you swallow me whole
On this continual path upon desolate sands

Cursed be those who led their sons to the path of the false salvation
Dreaming of being purified through redemption
Trusting in lies that blinds their minds with idolatry and misconception
Lies will lead them all to self-destruction

Servants bow your heads and obey to the church
Prayers waiting for the judgement
Observants, unveil the layer of falsity to see an uneasy
Truth there's no god to worship fuck it
Preachers, of the mystery of the holy ghost
Bullshits, hidden by confessions
Sinners, you will wash your dirty hands in your own flowing
Blood, atheistic light, no religion

Decimation of millions, indoctrinations of terror
Under the flags of the nations, under the scriptures of the ancients
Running to the dark oblivion, desolation of our souls
Waiting for the revelation, licking the honey of the false
Condemnation by the guides, no more Christ to sacrifice
A new reaction will delete, every single soldier of the church
Victim of the fear of god, our will's under your control
Every century has its cancer, every generation has its enemies
Every belief will kill us, every divinity is laughing
For the interests of a few tyrants, people will face their last journey
Wrong ideologies will guide us towards a catastrophic scenery
A new beginning is coming now, always starts with the end
The end of everything

No one will be missed by the fury of this massive mutilation
Flesh we are and flesh we'll be in putrefaction
They hold the free will with the lie of the saviour crucifixion
Lies will lead them all to final self-destruction

No recovering and no morphine can heal this society, a new army will come to reset their life
Reconstruct the morality of these injured minds, a new war will erase all these fucking lies

Cries, world is collapsing, men are defeated, fed up by anger and hate
Nothing remains only ashes, prayers are so useless to say
Ceremonials of destruction, sermons of death and despair
Bleeding remains of the west and east cultures now rot

Servants bow your heads and obey to the church
Prayers waiting for the judgement
Observants, unveil the layer of falsity to see an uneasy
Truth there's no god to worship fuck it
Preachers, of the mystery of the holy ghost
Bullshits, hidden by confessions
Sinners, you will wash your dirty hands in your own flowing
Blood, atheistic light

Cursed be those who led their sons to the path of the false salvation
Mind distortion by the greatest hallucination
Trusting in lies that blinds their minds with idolatry and misconception
Lies will lead them all to self-destruction

Trapped in world that's like a cage where false moralities delete
All possibilities of freedom
Live with a rational free mind is the worst sin we can commit
Disintegration of our free will
Free from the church to contrast the liars
Kill everyone is trying to infect your thoughts with the lie
Or to deceive your mind
Kill every time they try to reshape your morality
With deceit and lie

Seeds of deception, decay
Altered perception, disguise
They will manipulate your mind
They will manipulate your mind
Their primary aim is deceive
To violently caught you in a cage
Absorb the false hopes
Without a prayer left to say
Your sacrificed life
A useless offer

Everyone who believes men can do anything
To control their own free will and morality
Be those slaves left to rot
Everyone who desires to fight against them who rule
In the name of their religious supremacy
The time to rise has come

Prayers, denied by god, to save my soul
Lies, truths denied, truths disavowed

Trapped in world that's like a cage where false moralities delete
All possibilities of freedom
Live with a rational free mind is the worst sin we can commit
Disintegration of our free will
Free from the church to contrast the liars

Prophecy of a pregnancy
Greedily a holy virgin committed sins
Befouling his advent
Raped and left her in disgrace
An angel came and took her purity
As god commanded to him

god is coming into her!

Not even her blood, not even her screams,
Not even her tears will stop him from taking his decision
She is the only one, chosen for giving birth
To the miraculous newborn saviour of his vision
Violently as she chokes, violently as she chokes
Down on her knees she's the perfect figure of derision
Through her skin, through her blood, through her flood,
Every breath she takes she's collapsing to the floor
Dying

Raped to give a son to her god
Give birth to a filthy imposer who you'll going to pray
The saviour of men
The one who'll inject lies to your mind

The suffering, of procreation, in a slave state
Decaying with pain while pleasure him

Not even her blood, not even her screams,
Not even her tears will stop him from taking his decision
She is the only one, chosen for giving birth
To the miraculous newborn saviour of his vision
Violently as she chokes, violently as she chokes
Down on her knees she's the perfect figure of derision
Through her skin, through her blood, through her flood,
Every breath she takes she's collapsing to the floor
Dying

Prophecy of the awakening
Greedily a holy virgin will give birth
To the god-sent on the earth
Newborn of a filthy sin
Crawling like a worm inside the dead
You're son of rape and hate

Then he will be tempted by Seraphim
Tempted to accept serpentine offerings
Sent by the evil one to destroy his kingdom
Prophet of false and holy lies
Proclaimer of a decaying purity
Son of the holy and un-divine falsehood

Evil supremacy over the thrice holy
Killed, nailed, so viciously, cut his genitalia

An impure race of blinded sheep
They follow in line an infamous shepherd
Who holds their souls controls their deeds
Make them believe in words venomous seeds

False glorification of the unseen
Silent vile submission to the master
Preachers transform people in stupid puppets that believe
And never ask about the reasons of their power

Slow decomposition of their minds
A society sentenced to disaster
No-one left to lift the head and try to break the mental chains
That pull them down into the abyss of ignorance

Dope the men with falsity
Change their own morality

Truth, they'll never know
Truth, intoxicated humanity goes
False, blows in the words
False, while they pray trough the veins the venom flows

Slaves owned with falsity forever
Victims of the illusory verses of deceivers
Spend life praying a god who won't save 'em all when time will come

Fall those who have believed without doubt
Only death they deserve
Drowned in the own blood they will end
When the truth will rise again

An ingenuous race ruled with deceit
They serve in silence a lowest master
Who holds their souls controls their deeds
Make them believe in words venomous seeds

False glorification of the unseen
Silent vile submission to the master
Preachers transform people in stupid puppets that believe
And never ask about the reasons of their power

Truth, they'll never know
Truth, intoxicated humanity goes
False, blows in the words
False, while they pray trough the veins the venom flows

What is the real weight of our sins
How many good deeds
Where is the holy god
Who will set us free from this illusion of reality
Free of this trick
There's no god who answers
To all these questions
We are alone
Just the condemnation of the preachers

god denies the Reason, we're suffering in disdain
In our prison of sufferings
I committed high treason
Proving the certain non-existence of god
Through the truth
I became a disciple of the philosophy
Of truth denying false sacraments
god denies the Reason, we're suffering in disdain

god is not real, it's a false ideal
god is surreal, true threat of men

My mind is, my mind is chained to god
My mind is chained to the will of god
My own body is victim of every single sin
My mind is property of god

I defiled every single faith
Regarding his name
I will die by my own hands
Unbound by god's chains

Every single thought, every single word
Now will loose its sense
I must free myself from the chains of god
To perceive the truth
Now I can perceive the true essence of truth
Can you see the light?
I can see the light
Can you see the light?
Can you see it?

We can't do anything living in slavery
It will come as mass manipulation
Of your life, of your mind full of lies
Distorted perception, feeling dissection
Mental bomb that explodes in the fog
A white and green burst destroys the silence
In the decayed world of your mind
Until your mind will bleed
Until your words will bleed
Victim of the leaders of society

Kings of a world in a decaying situation
A self infliction of wounds
A slow catatonic destruction
A comatose state of the population

Slavery in a deaf decay
Chained mankind towards extinction
Starving worms consume our soul
Submissive behavior as our life code
Slavery in a deaf decay

Emptiness in our hearts the right way's far away
Unending dark hole in our deep down
Can philosophy save our life
Self inflicted deep wounds that are bleeding
Can our hate free ourselves from ourselves
All that you believe will be deleted
As the things that we loved were erased
Until your mind will bleed
Until your words will bleed
Victim of the leaders of society

Kings of a world in a decaying situation
A self infliction of wounds
A slow catatonic destruction
A comatose state of the population

Slavery in a deaf decay

The pursuit of purity is driving men
To the depths of the oblivion
Till the decimation of every faithful one
A false redemption represents the price
To pay for their salvation
A god laws they'll observe until the end

Is death the way to redeem yourself?
Is death the right way for salvation?
Is dead the price to satisfy your god?
With mercy, with mercy,
The holiness of self-infliction
The unknown value of immolation
For a false cause that scriptures claim as a new redemption
Cleansation of your souls
Cleansation through your blood
That flows out the veins in the street of the devastated lands of faith

We walk the earth
Hand to hand with death
Towards the desolation
Through the corpses and the slaves of the divination
Assoil our sins
In the asylum of the false hopes
We stand as fated
Firm in front of the holy betrayal

Is death the way to redeem yourself?
Is death the right way for salvation?
Is dead the price to satisfy your god?
With mercy, with mercy,
The holiness of self-infliction
The unknown value of immolation
For a false cause that scriptures claim as a new redemption

The pursuit of purity is driving men
To the depths of the oblivion
Till the decimation of every faithful one
A false redemption represents the price
To pay for their salvation
A god laws they'll observe until the end

Blood, blood gush in our eyes
There is no way of redemption in life
Blood, blood gushes in our eyes
The wings of death silently arise

Slave of a forthcoming world.
I walk a path of
solitude, step by,
step, until my precious grave,
further from where you are,
to fall one more time again.
Isolate, I made walls of silence.
Feed me with your emptiness,
triumph of weakness,
I've learned to afford it.

Things have never been so clear.
I must erase, replace
'till my nerves are tense.
I won't feel pain, I won't feel cold.

Emptiness brought me down
to desolation unknown.

Losing shape, I feel relief.
Between two plans of void
I'll make you suffocate
while you're bleeding from the outside.
That's what hate had built on me.

The more I see, the less I feel.
Catharsis in hate.
the creature escapes,
our worlds collapse.
Rising from the depths.
Humanity fades out.
Possession, flowing over me,
abnormality.

Suffer to survive.
Existing in quiet misery.

Slave of a forthcoming world.
I walk a path of
solitude, step by,
step, until my precious grave,
further from where you are,
to fall one more time.

Old flesh, shred.
Dependence that consumes,
the shadow that I've been.
The enemy within.
From hate to suffering.

The chains of god will break forth
Decimating his empire of splendour
Denying all his creations
Unbound we rise and destroy his reign
Torn apart in fragments and burn the scriptures of joy and grace

With the ashes of his empire, we will bury every church down in the sand
Inverted crosses will rise, as vexill of the triumph of men
Damned souls now walk on the earth claiming their revenge for his abuse
To reign the world in chaos 'till its destruction

We will break with force his majesty
We will spit against his cross
With the consciousness of our Reason
We will tear apart his son
Let his wisdom of grace fall
Let his words of falsity rot
Through the primal hate and iniquity
He will fall from his throne

Sing curses unto his name
Sing curses unto his name
Torn apart in fragments
The scriptures of joy and grace
As a un-divine conjuration
Against the holy creation
Against the father, the son and the holy ghost

The chains of god we will break forth
Decimating his empire of splendour
Decaying all his creations
Unbound we rise and destroy his reign
Inverted crosses will rise, as vexill of the triumph of men

Behold the fall of the tyrant
Behold the fall of the angels
Behold the fall of the reign of god

With the ashes of his empire, we will bury every church down in the sand
Throw your hopes into the fire we will bury every faith in the dust
Damned souls now walk on the earth claiming their revenge for his abuse
To reign the world in chaos till its destruction

Behold the chaos
Behold the tyrant's fall
Behold the chaos
Till its destruction

We will break with force his majesty
We will spit against his cross
We'll tear apart his son
Our conjuration sworn

Dead, he is dead, his famous death we have all heard of
But still, some people think, that they can turn to him for guidance
On the third day he came back from the dead that’s a Christian lie
Don’t you know that dead means dead stone cold is your Nazarene
On the cross nailed and dead your savior with his bowed head
Died on his wooden throne Nazarene

Still you seek his guidance on the cross nailed and dead

Fires burned everywhere when I woke up
I choked from the smell of burnt flesh
Nauseatingly sights everywhere
Bodies maimed head crushed
Villagers that I known all my life
Had their heads on poles by these men
Children’s screams and women’s cries
Echoed high before they died

Here I am sacrificed to your god
Fear as I see my friends die in front of me

Being dragged from our homes blindfolded
Unable to see anything
Yet I hear my friends scream
Cry for help scream in pain

Here I am sacrificed to your god
Fear as I see my friends die in front of me
Killed just to please a gods thirst for blood
Here I am sacrificed

 	Servant of emptiness
Scum of nothingness
Hidden behind the words of betrayal
Always speaking names in vain

Whore of conspiracy
Worm of conformity
Cowardly believer preacher of deceit
Feeding the scum of earthly gods

Faceless - fearful - weakened - son of worms
Cowardly descendant - you only exist to die for me

Enemy of everything you believe and pray for
I spew on the signs you praise and bow for

I'm the untamed defiant
The voice of the inexorable breed
Godless baptized by nothing
Spawn of chaos revelated

I'm the hand that kills
The voice of fierce roots
Holocaust of pagan idols
Summoning all bastards to fight

Nature of fury becomes my existence
Conceive the fall of what I disgust
Hateful nature feeds my existence
Exterminate the sheep as their lord

Visions beyond what I see
Ethereal lunacy descends on me

Lurking beyond my sleep
Behind the murdered light I roam
Deep water on fire
Deafening cries of wounded souls
Embraced unto forbidden confines
Of the dark sacrificial earth
I'm the offspring to be returned
To cast seeds of terror upon earth

Timeless nightmares of an undying soul
Origin of desolation
The eye of the undivine is upon me
Carry my curse to all my enemies

Your judgment is near
You got nowhere to go
I'll take you with pain
Playing with your suffering
To renew your sorrow
The sores heap in your corpse
Deterioration in the effect
The real cause of your torment
Condemns you until nothing remains

The manifest of your sentence
Emanates from your grave
Feel the evil undying
Behold your mortification
I can feel your cry
A cheap life, a dead man
Searching for a place in deepness
Like a soul chuchi's been condemns

They call me death
Death - in wind or rain
Death - at night and day
Death - feeling pain
Death - die with me

I'm your master now
We're the darkness
I'm the magic that follow you
In your body and your soul I’ll be

A strange force take my soul
I can see through the wall
Spirits run through my hands
Awake from my death
Now I do know my real being

Evil is the hand path
My beginning is the end
My peace is anguish
Real nightmare rising
Death feeling, fear feeling
I'll emanate all pain

Angels of hell follow my flame
Spittin' blood all over your head
Everybody crawls through the fire
Nothing left to live
Hell will conquer

I can't deny my fate
When the victory comes
I'll be the king, Lord of all evil
I knew the prophecy, I knew the pain

Slaves of disease, piled on, human suffer
The bird of prey eat this flesh
The rain turns into blood
All the dead become alive
All the water become fire
Endless nightmare
Hell has made our time

Hear the dark symphony
When the light becomes black
Under the blood's rain
Satan always calls your name
Uncaread for your God
Inherit the evil's control
This order always summoned you
Raise the black flag
Blood run out of your eyes
Plague's fever and death
All disease are spreadin' out
Unleashed the demon's wrath
Slaves of the dying world
The worms eat away their flesh
Blood blasts from the sky
Crosses toward hell

Rotten guts inside the body
The mankind cry out in despair
Rotten world, atrocious from hell
You get command, godless butcher
You must be alive forever

A powerful agression against your core
Crushing of your mind
Desolation of your being
Next to mortality
The walls listen up your cry
The confrontation with condemination

Born to meet your pain
Your soul wants your death
Comming from your brain
A tumor that rots in your head
The end of your sanity

And infected core who rejects the cure
Open sores, voices of despair
Your control was won by madness
Your hate is agony
Obsession, affliction, lasting infection

Your tortured face, show your disgrace
Nothing has price, all you feel is pain
Your body is like mortuary
Where disease rules
Spittin' blood, endless sacrifice
Infected gore

Your body is inert
Your heart does not beat
The rats will eat your flesh
The pigs will drink your blood
There's nothing dyrter
Nothing more rotten infection

Battalions of dethronement
Confront the invincible realm
Purge the imposing reign
Fear no overlord nor spell

A discharge of steel and distress
Tear down the gates of the fortress
Ride the battering ram clash
Spear and sword piercing flesh

Flaming arrows and molten wax
Swing the giant battle ax
Immortals dying at dawn
As the walls of the empire fall

Sword of immortal punishment
Behead thy highness
In a day of royal judgment
Scourge of the enthroned
Scourge of the enthroned

Despise the glory of the throne
The crown of filthiness begone
Decades of hollow supremacy
We bow to no majesty

Depose the inquisitor

Pillage the kingdom defiled
The empire overthrown

Sword of immortal punishment
Behead thy highness
In a day of royal judgment
Scourge of the enthroned

Fires of a conquering incursion
Burn the mighty throne to the ground
Enslave their women, usurp the crown
Hang the kingdom's servants at the dawn
Thorns piercing the hands
and the face of the nailed savior
The hope to be reborn
through resurrection is a failure
A snake in the tree on a garden
free of greed and sins
The whore of God spreads
the demon seed

The fate of a broken empire
Torched by flames of the purest fire
The end of a majestic age
The sorrowful queen kisses the savage blade

A storm of steel into a clash of shields
Kneel before beheading execution
The tormentor's hammer, kill after kill
Smashing heads on the anvil
Rebellious front, march to dethrone
Bring the opponent's defeat

Battalions of dethronement
Confront the invincible realm
Purge the imposing reign
Fear no overlord nor spell

Forged with fire, water and wind
Ride the colossal velocity
Timeless search for the secrecies
The elements of an abysmal frenzy
Unbreakable wheels turning viciously fast
The southern storm obliterates at last
Breed of the relentless legionnaire
Disciplined to embrace the warfare

Conquer the fear of thy enemy
Demonic wisdom and fury
When the serpent strikes relentlessly
Spew the poison of an envenomed mortality

Bad blood, infamous glory
Brotherhood’s loyalty
Damned tempo of profanation
We play the forbidden songs of your affliction

The number is three, we have been conceived
Unify the formula of this ultra speed
Hear the sound of the roaring of a true beast
Echoing forth through infinity
A tempo of the trio, the counterpoint of strangulation
Hammering down the nails of your crucifixion

Annihilate, burn and despise, sons of their own breed

Contagious minds erosion,

Decipher the wolf’s bloody oath
Darkened secrets of the lycanthropist code

Herald of the venomous spell of my father’s demonic fate
The harvest moon surrounds me like a cold embrace
I feel the freezing winds deforming and slashing my face
I feel the scent of death of 1000 graves

Long before the arrival of men
Giants and monsters were decimated
Pale lightning and annihilating winds
Tabbing viciously the punished land
Pure revolt of early devastations
Bring the fourth element into motion
Electrify the cradle of creation

The reaper rides the electric storm
The maelstrom calls the phenomenon
Skies entangled into blackened smoke
As a flash of discharge whips the globe

In a blast of electric monumental extermination
Pulverized universe, non-sacred condemnation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

In a blast of a shocking powerful elimination
Sentence the fallen creatures of primal creation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

Electrified, power surge of fire
Ignite the monumental pyre
Electrified, fatal discharge
Through silent screams, incinerations rise

In a blast of electric monumental extermination
Pulverized universe, non-sacred condemnation
Fire under mortal rain of decimation
Shock waves of conducting electric pain

Then the winds of progression have blown
In the hearts of men evil wisdom
Discovered secrets of warfare redemption
Nuclear infliction for relentless progression

Ominous shadows of a timeless conflict
Descending so darkened deadly and cold
The sands of an unmerciful holy slaughtering
Scorched by the merciless sun
Centuries of massacre and sorrow will follow
Into the abyss of misery eternal

The promised land annihilated as divided
Bloodshed and terror becomes divine
Slavery, dishonor and plague
Behead the children of god's disdain

Apocalypse of the army of redemption
Expulse the race of the unholy intrusion
Armed squads inflict decimation
Condemn and bleed the opposition
Behold the march of the refugee
The final procession of a carnage spree
Blood spill in this foretold destiny

The wrath divine, remains enshrined,
innocents' demise
Hang them high, blindfolded and tied,
Sign of brutal times

Broken souls, dead memories
Forgotten in the dust
The rage of faiths, fatal distrust
Many died in the fields of disgust

Obey the order of slavery
Praise the religious fanaticism
Escape the hail of bullets and blades
Or drown and die, engulfed by the sea

Thunderous cacophony of controlled rebellion
Night fast approaching to seal the end
Tyrant vessels swarm the horizon
Murky waters of death and despair
Conjuring the bringer of disease
Captivity to the gospel of fallacies

Ritual killings perpetuating the siege
Cursed progeny, nightmares unleashed
Bodies littered the shrine of misdeeds
Gruesome display haunting the fallen prayers

Symmetry of the opposites
In this battle of doomed deceit
Burn the bridges, storm the gates
Dreams and secrets, buried in the deep

In a gravitational solar storm
The wandering Nibiru was caught
Disturbing the fury of the planets
Colliding with the fierce Tiamat
As the moon became the imposing
Eternal night star of the earth
Lead the infernal tides of genocide
Blown unto the seas of holocaust

Cast out from the void of infinity
Through the whirlwind of the Annunaki
Savage ancestral humanity
The blow divine, the spawn of the humanoid

Violent gods were praised
To serve and to exterminate
The rise and fall
Of a existence dominated

The hours of life’s extensions
Relentlessly brought from distant dimensions
The origin of the soul, the flesh of sinful deeds
The carnage of infestation
Travelled from vengeful spheres
Promised to breed into annihilation
Souls of black entangled to madness
Wandering through eternity…relentless

Catastrophic days, to cleanse the ways
Savior’s betrayed, procreation untamed
The curses in numbers, the numbers in curses
Damned were the supernatural forces

Pyramids of brutal sacrificial rites
Ethereal revocations
Altars of bleeding, offers undead, sacred assassinations
Stairways of streams of blood to heavens enthroned
The knife of stone reaps the heart of the overthrown

In a gravitational solar storm
The wandering Nibiru was caught
Disturbing the fury of the planets
Colliding with the fierce Tiamat

I am my own God
Master slave and I will be beyond the grave
No one will take my soul away
I carry my own will and make my own day

I am my own God
See the truth beyond
Through endless lies and thy kingdom come
Glorified wisdom elimination tool
Self deceit is the true golden rule

Live your own life you're gonna die your own death
There's no one above that's gonna take away your breath

May the evil drown in its source

I dip my forefinger in the watery blood
Of your impotent redeemer
And write over his thorn torn brow
The true Prince of Evil

What man has created
Man can destroy
Bring to light
That day of joy

As the clouds so dark, so mighty
Hid the light of the moon from my eyes
I felt their presence even stronger
My invocation had caused them to rise

Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Dimensions of another kind

Between the gates and the ancient domains
How was I to know that halfway on my quest
They would have me drained

They’ve taken my body
In control but I bear
No anguish no malice
The god of all gods are entitled
I remember the times
I used to travel beyond
All of what is and what has been is gone in man’s mind

They’ve left me now to shiver and cry like a child
Left me with the humiliation of knowing,
I’m not worthy of what’s yet to come

By the dark and mighty waters
I’m standing here alone
To hear and suffer my sentence
To pay the price I owe
I’m drowned

Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Dimensions of another kind
Piercing their teeth into my skin and my flesh
Inner dimension beyond human conscience
I wish for only death

As your eyes filled are filled with horror
I lift up the corpse on the bench
You can’t avoid the dismal sight
It’s arms and legs I re-trench

Excavating it’s interior
To get a hold of what’s inside
And as I drivel and belch
You feel so damn reviled

As I continue with laughter
I drink the bowel’s rheum
Squeezing my hand through it’s mouth and further
Through it’s stomach to it’s womb

Of it’s once called body
There seems nothing to be left
And you better prepare yourself
For an equaling death

Revel in Flesh

Pools of coagulated blood
And rotten flesh by my side
Now I really need something more
To kill another day in my life

Stubborn old, worthless hag
Simply had nothing to give
I couldn't stand your eternal nag
You didn't deserve to live

So I went to the stove and took a pork knife
and stabbed it into your head
Buried you in the fruit cellar
I was glad 'cause I thought you were dead

But the maggots didn't feast on your body
You didn't get moldy as I thought
And still I can hear that nag in my head
You were supposed to rot

Supposed to Rot

Now she haunts me, day and night
A haunting I can't forget
The deed was a coldblooded homicide
a murder I regret

But still she's the same old hag
And still my life has turned the same
Isn't there anything to set me free from this wicked pain?

You were supposed to rot.
A rotten stench
Surrounds another ended life
Maggots infesting the rotten flesh
Is that the way you want to die?
Decomposed
Don't want to live in a decaying shell
But why should I go to heaven
And who's to say I'll enter hell

Dead - Deceased, but life goes on
I will be the one who won
My charred body will decay
But my soul will be floating anyway

Visually a corpse
But what's inside my head
Don't consider I once was deceased
So I guess I'll come back from the dead
Dying my death
In relentless aggrieve
Dead and put down in a wooden box
Just can't be my destiny

Dead - Deceased, but life goes on
I will be the one who won
Continue to seek and you will see
That life is your worst enemy
Bitter Loss

Blinded eyes
Blind towards reality
Subconcious lies
For whom did you really care?

Can't let go
Slave to this mastery
Stop searching for
The things you were never near

Falling tears
Falling from your sorrow
For the one
Who ripped your heart to shreds

Who are they for?
The dead one leaving peacefully
Better realize
Can't raise the one who's dead

Imaginary emotions
For someone that you cared for
Someone who isn't, but was
It's just the death of your ego that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss

Blinded eyes
Won't hold no consolation
Subconcious lies
Won't set you free
Your falling tears
Are all mistaken

Dead and buried
Maybe that will make you see

You're living out this lie
For the rest of your mortal life
Can't you fucking see
Stop living with that lie

Imaginary emotions
For someone that you cared for
Someone who isn't, but was
It's just the death of your ego that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss	 

A tumor of mould
Inherits you inside
Spreads in you
Soon to putrefy

Convulsion sets in
Relentless aggrieve
Stench of decay
Starts possessing visibility

Putrid stench
?????????
Infected body
Slowly putrefies

Heading for death
Flesh turns out to be mould
About these symptoms
You were never told

Decomposed to shreds
Bodily debris
Coagulated blood, moulded flesh
Surrounded by disease

Recently died
But limbs are moving anyway
Thoughts have ceased
But you scream in hysterical rage

People put to death in the name of God
And blood run red in an eternal flood
The word has been spread - Through out the centuries
Millions of corpses lying in the cemeteries

Reek of christianity
Down of obscuration
The birth of insanity
And death to liberation
Lord of evolution
Enslavement emperor
Root of all evil
It is the holy terror

God the almighty - The creator of Earth
Devote your life to this holy writ - The key to your rebirth
And if you've been a believer of justice and brave
So what! It shall be written on your grave

The bell summon its slaves to mass
In the darkest hour
To devour the body of Christ
The blood feast shall increase their power
Chalices filled to the edge with blood
Drawn from holy veins
Tearing his stomach open
And revel in the shredded remains

Smell the putrid stench
Of the godblessed crucifixion
And discover the lies
There is no resurrection
Get your eyes open wide
And discover the lies
See the truth beyond
The shadows of a false paradise!

You remember when he stuck
That hair curler up
Her wet and juicy hair pie

He was laughing like hell
While she was screaming in pain
It was the way he wanted her to die

Carnal leftovers on the floor
If you had come a little earlier
You would have seen some gore

He's staring down.
He took her breath.
Leaving a carnal stench behind.
He'll be curious to search for clues.
Carnal leftovers. The only thing to find.
